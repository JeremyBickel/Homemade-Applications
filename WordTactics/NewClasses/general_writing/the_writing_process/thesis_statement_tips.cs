//Tips and Examples for Writing Thesis Statements
// 
//Summary:
//This resource provides tips for creating a thesis statement and examples of different types of thesis statements.
//
//Tips for Writing Your Thesis Statement
//1. Determine what kind of paper you are writing:
//
//An analytical paper breaks down an issue or an idea into its component parts, evaluates the issue or idea, and presents this breakdown and evaluation to the audience.
//An expository (explanatory) paper explains something to the audience.
//An argumentative paper makes a claim about a topic and justifies this claim with specific evidence. The claim could be an opinion, a policy proposal, an evaluation, a cause-and-effect statement, or an interpretation. The goal of the argumentative paper is to convince the audience that the claim is true based on the evidence provided.
//
//If you are writing a text that does not fall under these three categories (e.g., a narrative), a thesis statement somewhere in the first paragraph could still be helpful to your reader.
//2. Your thesis statement should be specific&#8212;it should cover only what you will discuss in your paper and should be supported with specific evidence.
//3. The thesis statement usually appears at the end of the first paragraph of a paper.
//4. Your topic may change as you write, so you may need to revise your thesis statement to reflect exactly what you have discussed in the paper.
//Thesis Statement Examples
//Example of an analytical thesis statement:
// An analysis of the college admission process reveals one challenge facing counselors: accepting students with high test scores or students with strong extracurricular backgrounds.
//The paper that follows should:
//
//Explain the analysis of the college admission process
//Explain the challenge facing admissions counselors
//
//Example of an expository (explanatory) thesis statement:
// The life of the typical college student is characterized by time spent studying, attending class, and socializing with peers.
//The paper that follows should:
//
//Explain how students spend their time studying, attending class, and socializing with peers
//
//Example of an argumentative thesis statement:
// High school graduates should be required to take a year off to pursue community service projects before entering college in order to increase their maturity and global awareness.
//The paper that follows should:
//
//Present an argument and give evidence to support the claim that students should pursue community projects before entering college
