//Writing with Feedback Resource Overview
//Feedback is an integral part of any writing process. Writers don't write in a vacuum, especially in academic and professional contexts, where evaluation, review, and use of written work usually requires a number of people to be involved in the final product. Most students are familiar with peer review; similarly, scholarly articles are usually considered more trustworthy when they are double-blind peer reviewed, and writers in many workplaces usually get at least one colleague or boss's input.
//The pages in this resource address providing, interpreting, and writing with feedback&#160;from a number of perspectives and in a variety of settings. The goal of this resource is to help writers of all types (student, teacher, scholar, practitioner, etc.) give useful feedback, understand and analyze feedback they're given, and then use that feedback to improve their writing.
//
//Students in high school and early college classes will probably benefit most from the pages "Giving Feedback for Peer Review" and "Interpreting Instructor Feedback."
//Students in upper division college classes will probably benefit most from "Writing with Feedback," though the Peer Review and Interpreting Instructor Feedback pages may also be useful, depending on their context (linked above).
//Instructors, researchers, and practitioners will likely benefit most from "Instructor's Guide for Giving Feedback" and "Writing with Feedback."
