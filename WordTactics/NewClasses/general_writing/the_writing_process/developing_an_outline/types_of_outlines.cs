//Alphanumeric Outlines
//This is the most common type of outline and usually instantly recognizable to most people. The formatting follows these characters, in this order:
//
//Roman Numerals
//Capitalized Letters
//Arabic Numerals
//Lowercase Letters
//
//If the outline needs to subdivide beyond these divisions, use Arabic numerals inside parentheses and then lowercase letters inside parentheses. Select the "Sample Outlines" PDF in the Media Box above to download the sample of this outline.
//The sample PDF in the Media Box above is an example of an outline that a student might create before writing an essay. In order to organize her thoughts and make sure that she has not forgotten any key points that she wants to address, she creates the outline as a framework for her essay.
//What is the assignment?
//Your instructor asks the class to write an expository (explanatory) essay on the typical steps a high school student would follow in order to apply to college.
//What is the purpose of this essay?
//To explain the process for applying to college
//Who is the intended audience for this essay?
//High school students intending to apply to college and their parents
//What is the essay's thesis statement?
//When applying to college, a student follows a certain process which includes choosing the right schools and preparing the application materials.
//Full Sentence Outlines
//The full sentence outline format is essentially the same as the Alphanumeric outline. The main difference (as the title suggests) is that full sentences are required at each level of the outline. This outline is most often used when preparing a traditional essay. Select the "Sample Outlines" PDF in the Media Box above to download the sample of this outline.
//Decimal Outlines
//The decimal outline is similar in format to the alphanumeric outline. The added benefit is a system of decimal notation that clearly shows how every level of the outline relates to the larger whole. Select the "Sample Outlines" PDF in the Media Box above to download the sample of this outline.
