//Common Writing Assignments
// 
//These OWL resources will help you understand and complete specific types of writing assignments, such as annotated bibliographies, book reports, and research papers. This section also includes resources on writing academic proposals for conference presentations, journal articles, and books.
//
//<!--
//Understanding Writing Assignments
//This resource describes some steps you can take to better understand the requirements of your writing assignments. This resource works for either in-class, teacher-led discussion or for personal use.
//Argument Papers
//This resource outlines the generally accepted structure for introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions in an academic argument paper. Keep in mind that this resource contains guidelines and not strict rules about organization. Your structure needs to be flexible enough to meet the requirements of your purpose and audience.
//Research Papers
//This handout provides detailed information about how to write research papers including discussing research papers as a genre, choosing topics, and finding sources.
//Exploratory Papers
//This resource will help you with exploratory/inquiry essay assignments.
//Annotated Bibliographies
//This handout provides information about annotated bibliographies in MLA, APA, and CMS.
//Book Report
//This resource discusses book reports and how to write them.
//Definitions
//This handout provides suggestions and examples for writing definitions.
//Essays for Exams
//While most OWL resources recommend a longer writing process (start early, revise often, conduct thorough research, etc.), sometimes you just have to write quickly in test situations. However, these exam essays can be no less important pieces of writing than research papers because they can influence final grades for courses, and/or they can mean the difference between getting into an academic program (GED, SAT, GRE). To that end, this resource will help you prepare and write essays for exams.
//Book Review
//This resource discusses book reviews and how to write them.
//Academic Proposals
//This resource will help undergraduate, graduate, and professional scholars write proposals for academic conferences, articles, and books.
