//Understanding Writing Assignments
// 
//Summary:
//This resource describes some steps you can take to better understand the requirements of your writing assignments. This resource works for either in-class, teacher-led discussion or for personal use.
//
//How to Decipher the Paper Assignment
//Many instructors write their assignment prompts differently. By following a few steps, you can better understand the requirements for the assignment. The best way, as always, is to ask the instructor about anything confusing.
//
//Read the prompt the entire way through once. This gives you an overall view of what is going on.
//Underline or circle the portions that you absolutely must know. This information may include due date, research (source) requirements, page length, and format (MLA, APA, CMS).
//Underline or circle important phrases. You should know your instructor at least a little by now - what phrases do they use in class? Does he repeatedly say a specific word? If these are in the prompt, you know the instructor wants you to use them in the assignment.
//Think about how you will address the prompt. The prompt contains clues on how to write the assignment. Your instructor will often describe the ideas they want discussed either in questions, in bullet points, or in the text of the prompt. Think about each of these sentences and number them so that you can write a paragraph or section of your essay on that portion if necessary.
//Rank ideas in descending order, from most important to least important. Instructors may include more questions or talking points than you can cover in your assignment, so rank them in the order you think is more important. One area of the prompt may be more interesting to you than another.
//Ask your instructor questions if you have any.
//
//After you are finished with these steps, ask yourself the following:
//
//What is the purpose of this assignment? Is my purpose to provide information without forming an argument, to construct an argument based on research, or analyze a poem and discuss its imagery?
//Who is my audience? Is my instructor my only audience? Who else might read this? Will it be posted online? What are my readers' needs and expectations?
//What resources do I need to begin work? Do I need to conduct literature (hermeneutic or historical) research, or do I need to review important literature on the topic and then conduct empirical research, such as a survey or an observation? How many sources are required?
//Who - beyond my instructor - can I contact to help me if I have questions? Do you have a writing lab or student service center that offers tutorials in writing?
//
//Examples
//(Notes on prompts made in blue)
//Poster or Song Analysis: Poster or Song? Poster!
//Goals: To systematically consider the rhetorical choices made in either a poster or a song. She says that all the time.
//Things to Consider: ah- talking points
//Poster:
//
//how the poster addresses its audience and is affected by context I'll do this first - 1.
//general layout, use of color, contours of light and shade, etc.
//use of contrast, alignment, repetition, and proximity C.A.R.P. They say that, too. I'll do this third - 3.
//the point of view the viewer is invited to take, poses of figures in the poster, etc. any text that may be present
//possible cultural ramifications or social issues that have bearing I'll cover this second - 2.
//ethical implications
//how the poster affects us emotionally, or what mood it evokes
//the poster's implicit argument and its effectiveness said that was important in class, so I'll discuss this last - 4.
//
//Song:
//
//how the song addresses its audience
//lyrics: how they rhyme, repeat, what they say
//use of music, tempo, different instruments
//possible cultural ramifications or social issues that have bearing
//ethical implications
//emotional effects
//the implicit argument and its effectiveness
//
//These thinking points are not a step-by-step guideline on how to write your paper; instead, they are various means through which you can approach the subject. I do expect to see at least a few of them addressed, and there are other aspects that may be pertinent to your choice that have not been included in these lists. You will want to find a central idea and base your argument around that. Additionally, you must include a copy of the poster or song that you are working with. Really important!
//I will be your audience. This is a formal paper, and you should use academic conventions throughout.
//Length: 4 pages Format: Typed, double-spaced, 10-12 point Times New Roman, 1 inch margins I need to remember the format stuff. I messed this up last time =(
//Academic Argument Essay
//5-7 pages, Times New Roman 12 pt. font, 1 inch margins.
//Minimum of five cited sources: 3 must be from academic journals or books
//
//Design Plan due: Thurs. 10/19
//Rough Draft due: Monday 10/30
//Final Draft due: Thurs. 11/9
//
//Remember this! I missed the deadline last time
//The design plan is simply a statement of purpose, as described on pages 40-41 of the book, and an outline. The outline may be formal, as we discussed in class, or a printout of an Open Mind project. It must be a minimum of 1 page typed information, plus 1 page outline.
//This project is an expansion of your opinion editorial. While you should avoid repeating any of your exact phrases from Project 2, you may reuse some of the same ideas. Your topic should be similar. You must use research to support your position, and you must also demonstrate a fairly thorough knowledge of any opposing position(s). 2 things to do - my position and the opposite.
//Your essay should begin with an introduction that encapsulates your topic and indicates 1 the general trajectory of your argument. You need to have a discernable thesis that appears early in your paper. Your conclusion should restate the thesis in different words, 2 and then draw some additional meaningful analysis out of the developments of your argument. Think of this as a "so what" factor. What are some implications for the future, relating to your topic? What does all this (what you have argued) mean for society, or for the section of it to which your argument pertains? A good conclusion moves outside the topic in the paper and deals with a larger issue.
//You should spend at least one paragraph acknowledging and describing the opposing position in a manner that is respectful and honestly representative of the opposition&#8217;s 3 views. The counterargument does not need to occur in a certain area, but generally begins or ends your argument. Asserting and attempting to prove each aspect of your argument&#8217;s structure should comprise the majority of your paper. Ask yourself what your argument assumes and what must be proven in order to validate your claims. Then go step-by-step, paragraph-by-paragraph, addressing each facet of your position. Most important part!
//Finally, pay attention to readability. Just because this is a research paper does not mean that it has to be boring. Use examples and allow your opinion to show through word choice and tone. Proofread before you turn in the paper. Your audience is generally the academic community and specifically me, as a representative of that community. Ok, They want this to be easy to read, to contain examples I find, and they want it to be grammatically correct. I can visit the tutoring center if I get stuck, or I can email the OWL Email Tutors short questions if I have any more problems.
