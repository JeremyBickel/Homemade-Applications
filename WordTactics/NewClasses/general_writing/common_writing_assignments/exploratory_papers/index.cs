//Introductions, Body Paragraphs, and Conclusions for Exploratory Papers
// 
//Summary:
//This resource will help you with exploratory/inquiry essay assignments.
//
//Many paper assignments call for you to establish a position and defend that position with an effective argument. However, some assignments are not argumentative, but rather, they are exploratory. Exploratory essays ask questions and gather information that may answer these questions. However, the main point of the exploratory or inquiry essay is not to find definite answers. The main point is to conduct inquiry into a topic, gather information, and share that information with readers.
//Introductions for Exploratory Essays
//The introduction is the broad beginning of the paper that answers three important questions:
//
//What is this?
//Why am I reading it?
//What do you want me to do?
//
//You should answer these questions in an exploratory essay by doing the following:
//
//Set the context &#8211; provide general information about the main idea, explaining the situation so the reader can make sense of the topic and the questions you will ask
//State why the main idea is important &#8211; tell the reader why they should care and keep reading. Your goal is to create a compelling, clear, and educational essay people will want to read and act upon
//State your research question &#8211; compose a question or two that clearly communicate what you want to discover and why you are interested in the topic. An overview of the types of sources you explored might follow your research question.
//
//If your inquiry paper is long, you may want to forecast how you explored your topic by outlining the structure of your paper, the sources you considered, and the information you found in these sources. Your forecast could read something like this:
// 
//In order to explore my topic and try to answer my research question, I began with news sources. I then conducted research in scholarly sources, such as peer-reviewed journals. Lastly, I conducted an interview with a primary source. All these sources gave me a better understanding of my topic, and even though I was not able to fully answer my research questions, I learned a lot and narrowed my subject for the next paper assignment, the problem-solution report.
//
//For this OWL resource, the example exploratory process investigates a local problem to gather more information so that eventually a solution may be suggested.
//Identify a problem facing your University (institution, students, faculty, staff) or the local area and conduct exploratory research to find out as much as you can on the following:
//
//Causes of the problem and other contributing factors
//People/institutions involved in the situation: decision makers and stakeholders
//Possible solutions to the problem.
//
//You do not have to argue for a solution to the problem at this point. The point of the exploratory essay is to ask an inquiry question and find out as much as you can to try to answer your question. Then write about your inquiry and findings.
