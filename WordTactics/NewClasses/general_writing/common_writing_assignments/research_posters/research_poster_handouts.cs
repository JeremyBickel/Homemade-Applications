//Supplementary Handouts
//Creating supplementary handouts is not a requirement for the research poster genre, however they might be useful for your audence &#8212; especially when your poster is featured at academic conferences, for example. Providing handouts of your presentation materials allow your audience to engage directly with the content through a tangible summary of your research. 
//It is not necessary to include your entire poster or the content of your presentation on a handout, but rather to reiterate the research questions and results. When creating a handout, ensure that the organization of your content allows for accessible reading and utilizes a consistent layout. As a general rule of thumb, be certain to include citations and your contact information, on your handout.
