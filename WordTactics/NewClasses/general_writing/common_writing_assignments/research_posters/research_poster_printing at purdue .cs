//Printing Research Posters at Purdue
//Purdue offers wide format printing through Papercut. Papercut is a separate service from traditional Purdue printing and does not accept funds from your printing quota. In order to load money onto Papercut, you must add funds to your BoilerExpress account and transfer them to your Papercut account. 
//Wide format printing at Purdue costs $4 per foot for both the 36&#8221; and 40&#8221; options, with a 36&#8221; x 24&#8221; poster costing $8 as of October 2017. The wide format printers are located on the second floor of the Wilmeth Active Learning Center and the first floor of the main floor of the Hicks Undergraduate Library.
