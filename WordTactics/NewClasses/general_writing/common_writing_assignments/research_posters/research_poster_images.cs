//Using Images
//Images can be used to enhance the textual content of a research poster. When selecting images, it is important to ensure that they are of a high-quality resolution and that they depict content relevant to your research. Photos should be saved as .jpg or .png files and adjusted for color and contrast if necessary.
//Providing captions for your images allow you to contextualize the relevance of this visual content as it relates to your research. When utilizing maps, charts, or graphs, be sure to create labels to describe the data you are presenting. Take note of the citation style that you're using &#8212; APA, for example, has specific requirements for captioning and labeling graphs, tables, and figures.&#160;
