//Research Poster Overview
//The purpose of a research poster is to visually represent the general overview, data, and most relevant findings of a research project. Typically, research posters accompany an oral presentation of the project conducted, but should also be able to independently represent the research. The elements of a research poster include the abstract, the research questions, methodologies, results, and the conclusions. An effective research poster should provide a clean and consistent layout, emphasize research questions and results, utilize purposeful graphics and visuals, have readily accessible text, and include citations as well as contact information.&#160;
