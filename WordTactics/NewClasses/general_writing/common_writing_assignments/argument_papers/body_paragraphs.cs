//Body Paragraphs
// 
//Summary:
//This resource outlines the generally accepted structure for introductions, body paragraphs, and conclusions in an academic argument paper. Keep in mind that this resource contains guidelines and not strict rules about organization. Your structure needs to be flexible enough to meet the requirements of your purpose and audience.
//
//Body paragraphs: Moving from general to specific information
//Your paper should be organized in a manner that moves from general to specific information. Every time you begin a new subject, think of an inverted pyramid - The broadest range of information sits at the top, and as the paragraph or paper progresses, the author becomes more and more focused on the argument ending with specific, detailed evidence supporting a claim. Lastly, the author explains how and why the information she has just provided connects to and supports her thesis (a brief wrap-up or warrant).
// 
// 
//Moving from General to Specific Information
//
//
//The four elements of a good paragraph (TTEB)
//A good paragraph should contain at least the following four elements: Transition, Topic sentence, specific Evidence and analysis, and a Brief wrap-up sentence (also known as a warrant) &#8211;TTEB!
//
//A Transition sentence leading in from a previous paragraph to assure smooth reading. This acts as a hand-off from one idea to the next.
//A Topic sentence that tells the reader what you will be discussing in the paragraph.
//Specific Evidence and analysis that supports one of your claims and that provides a deeper level of detail than your topic sentence.
//A Brief wrap-up sentence that tells the reader how and why this information supports the paper&#8217;s thesis. The brief wrap-up is also known as the warrant. The warrant is important to your argument because it connects your reasoning and support to your thesis, and it shows that the information in the paragraph is related to your thesis and helps defend it.
//
//Supporting evidence (induction and deduction)
//Induction
//Induction is the type of reasoning that moves from specific facts to a general conclusion. When you use induction in your paper, you will state your thesis (which is actually the conclusion you have come to after looking at all the facts) and then support your thesis with the facts. The following is an example of induction taken from Dorothy U. Seyler&#8217;s Understanding Argument:
//Facts:
//There is the dead body of Smith. Smith was shot in his bedroom between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., according to the coroner. Smith was shot with a .32 caliber pistol. The pistol left in the bedroom contains Jones&#8217;s fingerprints. Jones was seen, by a neighbor, entering the Smith home at around 11:00 p.m. the night of Smith&#8217;s death. A coworker heard Smith and Jones arguing in Smith&#8217;s office the morning of the day Smith died.
//Conclusion: Jones killed Smith.
//Here, then, is the example in bullet form:
//
//Conclusion: Jones killed Smith
//Support: Smith was shot by Jones&#8217; gun, Jones was seen entering the scene of the crime, Jones and Smith argued earlier in the day Smith died.
//Assumption: The facts are representative, not isolated incidents, and thus reveal a trend, justifying the conclusion drawn.
//
//Deduction
//When you use deduction in an argument, you begin with general premises and move to a specific conclusion. There is a precise pattern you must use when you reason deductively. This pattern is called syllogistic reasoning (the syllogism). Syllogistic reasoning (deduction) is organized in three steps:
//
//Major premise
//Minor premise
//Conclusion
//
//In order for the syllogism (deduction) to work, you must accept that the relationship of the two premises lead, logically, to the conclusion. Here are two examples of deduction or syllogistic reasoning:
//Socrates
//
//Major premise: All men are mortal.
//Minor premise: Socrates is a man.
//Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.
//
//Lincoln
//
//Major premise: People who perform with courage and clear purpose in a crisis are great leaders.
//Minor premise: Lincoln was a person who performed with courage and a clear purpose in a crisis.
//Conclusion: Lincoln was a great leader.
//
//So in order for deduction to work in the example involving Socrates, you must agree that (1) all men are mortal (they all die); and (2) Socrates is a man. If you disagree with either of these premises, the conclusion is invalid. The example using Socrates isn&#8217;t so difficult to validate. But when you move into more murky water (when you use terms such as courage, clear purpose, and great), the connections get tenuous.
//For example, some historians might argue that Lincoln didn&#8217;t really shine until a few years into the Civil War, after many Union losses to Southern leaders such as Robert E. Lee.
//The following is a clear example of deduction gone awry:
//
//Major premise: All dogs make good pets.
//Minor premise: Doogle is a dog.
//Conclusion: Doogle will make a good pet.
//
//If you don&#8217;t agree that all dogs make good pets, then the conclusion that Doogle will make a good pet is invalid.
//Enthymemes
//When a premise in a syllogism is missing, the syllogism becomes an enthymeme. Enthymemes can be very effective in argument, but they can also be unethical and lead to invalid conclusions. Authors often use enthymemes to persuade audiences. The following is an example of an enthymeme:
//If you have a plasma TV, you are not poor.
//The first part of the enthymeme (If you have a plasma TV) is the stated premise. The second part of the statement (you are not poor) is the conclusion. Therefore, the unstated premise is &#8220;Only rich people have plasma TVs.&#8221; The enthymeme above leads us to an invalid conclusion (people who own plasma TVs are not poor) because there are plenty of people who own plasma TVs who are poor. Let&#8217;s look at this enthymeme in a syllogistic structure:
//
//Major premise: People who own plasma TVs are rich (unstated above).
//Minor premise: You own a plasma TV.
//Conclusion: You are not poor.
//
//To help you understand how induction and deduction can work together to form a solid argument, you may want to look at the United States Declaration of Independence. The first section of the Declaration contains a series of syllogisms, while the middle section is an inductive list of examples. The final section brings the first and second sections together in a compelling conclusion.
