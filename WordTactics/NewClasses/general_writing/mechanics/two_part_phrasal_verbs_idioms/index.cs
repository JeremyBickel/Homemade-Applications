//Overview of Two-Part (Phrasal) Verbs (Idioms)
// 
//Summary:
//Provides an overview and lists of phrasal/two part verbs.
//
//Many verbs in English are followed by an adverb or a preposition (also called a particle), and these two-part verbs, also called phrasal verbs, are different from verbs with helpers. The particle that follows the verb changes the meaning of the phrasal verb in idiomatic ways:
//
//drop off - decline gradually
//The hill dropped off near the river
//
//drop off(2) - fall asleep
//While doing his homework, he dropped off.
//
//drop off(3) - stop and give something to someone
//Would you drop this off at the post office?
//
//drop out - cease to participate
//After two laps, the runner dropped out.
//
//
//Some particles can be separated from the verb so that a noun or pronoun can be inserted, and some particles can't be separated from the verb. In addition, some phrases are intransitive, meaning they cannot take a direct object.
//
//Separable  add up (meaning: to add)
//Correct: She added up the total on her calculator.  Correct: She added it up on her calculator.
//
//Inseparable  get around (meaning: to evade)
//Correct: She always gets around the rules. Incorrect: She always gets the rules around (This construction makes no sense in English.)
//
//Intransitive  catch on (meaning: to understand)
//Correct: After I explained the math problem, she began to catch on. Incorrect: She began to catch on the math problem. (catch on cannot take a direct object in this meaning.) Correct: She began to catch on to the math problem. (the word to makes the math problem an indirect object, which is acceptable in this meaning.)
//
//
//Unfortunately, there is usually no indicator whether an idiomatic phrase is separable, inseparable, or intransitive. In most cases the phrases must simply be memorized. Below is a partial list of each kind of phrase.
