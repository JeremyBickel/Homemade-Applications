//A Little Help with Capitals
// 
//Summary:
//This resource details standard capitalization rules.
//
//This handout lists some guidelines for capitalization. If you have a question about whether a specific word should be capitalized that doesn't fit under one of these rules, try checking a dictionary to see if the word is capitalized there.
//Use capital letters in the following ways:
//The first words of a sentence
// When he tells a joke, he sometimes forgets the punch line.
//The pronoun "I"
// The last time I visited Atlanta was several years ago.
//Proper nouns (the names of specific people, places, organizations, and sometimes things)
// Worrill Fabrication Company
// Golden Gate Bridge
// Supreme Court
// Livingston, Missouri
// Atlantic Ocean
// Mothers Against Drunk Driving
//Family relationships (when used as proper names)
// I sent a thank-you note to Aunt Abigail but not to my other aunts.
// Here is a present I bought for Mother.
// Did you buy a present for your mother?
//The names of God, specific deities, religious figures, and holy books
// God the Father
// the Virgin Mary
// the Bible
// the Greek gods
// Moses
// Shiva
// Buddha
// Zeus
//Exception: Do not capitalize the nonspecific use of the word "god."
// The word "polytheistic" means the worship of more than one god.
//Titles preceding names, but not titles that follow names
// She worked as the assistant to Mayor Hanolovi.
// I was able to interview Miriam Moss, mayor of Littonville.
//Directions that are names (North, South, East, and West when used as sections of the country, but not as compass directions)
