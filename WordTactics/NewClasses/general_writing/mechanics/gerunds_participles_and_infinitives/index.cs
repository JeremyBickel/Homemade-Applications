//Gerunds
// 
//Summary:
//This handout provides a detailed overview (including descriptions and examples) of gerunds, participles, and infinitives.
//
//A gerund is a verbal that ends in -ing and functions as a noun. The term verbal indicates that a gerund, like the other two kinds of verbals, is based on a verb and therefore expresses action or a state of being. However, since a gerund functions as a noun, it occupies some positions in a sentence that a noun ordinarily would, for example: subject, direct object, subject complement, and object of preposition.
//Gerund as subject:
//
//Traveling might satisfy your desire for new experiences. (Traveling is the gerund.)
//The study abroad program might satisfy your desire for new experiences. (The gerund has been removed.)
//
//Gerund as direct object:
//
//They do not appreciate my singing. (The gerund is singing.)
//They do not appreciate my assistance. (The gerund has been removed)
//
//Gerund as subject complement:
//
//My cat's favorite activity is sleeping. (The gerund is sleeping.)
//My cat's favorite food is salmon. (The gerund has been removed.)
//
//Gerund as object of preposition:
//
//The police arrested him for speeding. (The gerund is speeding.)
//The police arrested him for criminal activity. (The gerund has been removed.)
//
//A gerund phrase is a group of words consisting of a gerund and the modifier(s) and/or (pro)noun(s) or noun phrase(s) that function as the direct object(s), indirect object(s), or complement(s) of the action or state expressed in the gerund, such as:
//The gerund phrase functions as the subject of the sentence.
// Finding a needle in a haystack would be easier than what we're trying to do.
//Finding (gerund) a needle (direct object of action expressed in gerund) in a haystack (prepositional phrase as adverb)
// The gerund phrase functions as the direct object of the verb appreciate. 
// I hope that you appreciate my offering you this opportunity.
//my (possessive pronoun adjective form, modifying the gerund) offering (gerund) you (indirect object of action expressed in gerund) this opportunity (direct object of action expressed in gerund)
// The gerund phrase functions as the subject complement. 
// Tom's favorite tactic has been jabbering away  to his constituents.
//jabbering away to (gerund) his constituents (direct object of action expressed in gerund)
// The gerund phrase functions as the object of the preposition for. 
// You might get in trouble for faking an illness to avoid work.
//faking (gerund) an illness (direct object of action expressed in gerund) to avoid work (infinitive phrase as adverb)
// The gerund phrase functions as the subject of the sentence. 
// Being the boss made Jeff feel uneasy.
//Being (gerund) the boss (subject complement for Jeff, via state of being expressed in gerund)
//Punctuation
//A gerund virtually never requires any punctuation with it.
//Points to remember:
//
//A gerund is a verbal ending in -ing that is used as a noun.
//A gerund phrase consists of a gerund plus modifier(s), object(s), and/or complement(s).
//Gerunds and gerund phrases virtually never require punctuation.
