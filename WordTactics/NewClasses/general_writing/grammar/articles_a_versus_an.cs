//Articles: A versus An
// 
//Summary:
//This short handout deals with which article to use before a noun -- "a" or "an."
//
//How do you know when to use the indefinite articles?
//The choice of article is based upon the phonetic (sound) quality of the first letter in a word, not on the orthographic (written) representation of the letter. If the first letter makes a vowel-type sound, you use "an"; if the first letter would make a consonant-type sound, you use "a." However, even if you follow these basic rules when deciding to use "a" or "an," remember that there are some exceptions to these rules.
//"A" goes before words that begin with consonants.
//
//a cat
//a dog
//a purple onion
//a buffalo
//a big apple
//
//"An" goes before words that begin with vowels:
//
//an apricot
//an egg
//an Indian
//an orbit
//an uprising
//
//Exceptions
//Use "an" before a slient or unsounded "h." Because the "h" does not have any phonetic representation or audible sound, the sound that follows the article is a vowel; consequently, "an" is used.
//
//an honorable peace
//an honest error
//
//When "u" makes the same sound as the "y" in "you," or "o" makes the same sound as "w" in "won," then a is used. The word-initial "y" sound ("unicorn") is a glide [j] phonetically, which has consonantal properties; consequently, it is treated as a consonant, requiring "a."
//
//a union
//a united front
//a unicorn
//a used napkin
//a U.S. ship
//a one-legged man
