//Count and Noncount Nouns: Basic Rules
// 
//Summary:
//This handout discusses the differences between count nouns and noncount nouns. Count nouns can be pluralized; noncount nouns cannot.
//
//Adjectives with Countable and Uncountable Nouns
//The Basic Rules: Count and Noncount Nouns
//A count noun is one that can be expressed in plural form, usually with an "s." For example, "cat&#8212;cats," "season&#8212;seasons," "student&#8212;students."
//A noncount noun is one that usually cannot be expressed in a plural form. For example, "milk," "water," "air," "money," "food." Usually, you cannot say, "He had many moneys."
//Count and Noncount Nouns with Adjectives
//Most of the time, this does not matter with adjectives. For example, you can say, "The cat was gray" or "The air was gray." However, the difference between a countable and uncountable noun does matter with certain adjectives, such as "some/any," "much/many," and "little/few."
//Some/Any: Some and any countable and uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is some water on the floor."
//"There are some students here."
//"Do you have any food?"
//"Do you have any apples?"
//
//Much/Many: Much modifies only uncountable nouns. Many modifies only countable nouns.
//
//"We don't have much time to get this done."
//"Many Americans travel to Europe."
//
//Little/Few: Little modifies only uncountable nouns.
//
//"He had little food in the house."
//"The doctor had little time to think in the emergency room."
//
//Few modifies only countable nouns.
//
//"There are few doctors in town."
//"Few students like exams."
//
//Other basic rules
//A lot of/lots of: A lot of/lots of are informal substitutes for much and many. They are used with uncountable nouns when they mean much and with countable nouns when they mean many.
//
//"They have lots of (much) money in the bank."
//"A lot of (many) Americans travel to Europe."
//"We got lots of (many) mosquitoes last summer."
//"We got lots of (much) rain last summer."
//
//A little bit of: A little bit of is informal and always precedes an uncountable noun.
//
//"There is a little bit of pepper in the soup."
//"There is a little bit of snow on the ground."
//
//Enough: Enough modifies both countable and uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is enough money to buy a car."
//"I have enough books to read."
//
//Plenty of: Plenty of modifies both countable and uncountable nouns.
//
//"They have plenty of money in the bank."
//"There are plenty of millionaires in Switzerland."
//
//No: No modifies both countable and uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is no time to finish now."
//"There are no squirrels in the park."
