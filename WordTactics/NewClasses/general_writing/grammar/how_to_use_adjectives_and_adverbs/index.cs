//Adjectives with Countable and Uncountable Nouns
// 
//Summary:
//This resource provides basic guidelines of adjective and adverb use.
//
//The Basic Rules: Adjectives
//A  countable noun  is usually something you can count quantitatively.  Countable nouns  can be expressed in plural form, usually by adding an &#8220;s&#8221; to the singular form. For example, "cat--cats," "season--seasons," "student--students."
//Usually, you can add a numerical quantity to such nouns, like &#8220;two cats&#8221; or &#8220;two students&#8221;. If you aren&#8217;t sure whether a noun is countable or not countable, try attaching a number to it. He had &#8220;two respects&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t work, so &#8220;respect&#8221; is an  uncountable noun  .
//An  uncountable noun  is a noun that usually cannot be expressed in a plural form. It is not something you can quantify. For example, "milk," "water," "air," "money," "food" are uncountable nouns. Usually, you can't say, "He had many moneys." or &#8220;The airs smelled good this morning.&#8221;
//Milk and water are  uncountable nouns . However, you may hear someone say, &#8220;Can I have two milks?&#8221; or &#8220;You should get two waters.&#8221; In these particular cases, the person has simply dropped off the  countable part of the phrase: &#8220;Can I have two [ cartons  of] milk?&#8221; or &#8220;You should get two [ bottles of] water.&#8221; In these cases, adding an &#8220;s&#8221; to milk and water is accepted in verbal speech, but you wouldn&#8217;t normally do so in a writing class.
//Most adjectives can modify both  countable and  uncountable nouns . For example, you can say, "The cat was gray" or "The air was gray." However, the difference between a countable and uncountable noun does matter with certain adjectives, such as the following:
//
//much/many
//a lot of/lots of
//little/few
//a little bit of
//some/any
//plenty of
//enough
//no
//
//Much/Many
//"Much" modifies only  uncountable nouns.
//
//"They have so much  money in the bank."
//"The horse drinks so much  water ."
//
//"Many" modifies only  countable nouns.
//
//"Many  Americans travel to Europe."
//"I collected many  sources for my paper."
//
//Much or Many?
//Incorrect Examples:
//
//&#8220;She wears so much  rings &#8221; should be written as, &#8220;She wears so many  rings .&#8221;
//&#8220;You deserve some many needed  rest &#8221; should be, &#8220;You deserve some much needed  rest .&#8221;
//&#8220;Much  trees line the street.&#8221; should be written as, &#8220;Many  trees line the street.&#8221;
//&#8220;I have done many  research in that field&#8221; should be, &#8220;I have done much  research in that field.&#8221;
//
//A lot of/lots of
//"A lot of" and "lots of" are informal substitutes for much and many. They are used with  uncountable  nouns when they mean "much" and with  countable nouns when they mean "many."
//
//"They have lots of (much)  money in the bank."
//"A lot of (many)  Americans travel to Europe."
//"We got lots of (many)  mosquitoes last summer."
//"We got a lot of (much)  rain last summer."
//
//Little/Few
//"Little" modifies only uncountable nouns.
//
//"He had little food in the house."
//"When I was in college, there was little money to spare."
//
//"Few" modifies only  countable nouns.
//
//"There are a few doctors in town."
//"He had few reasons for his opinion."
//
//Little or Few?
//Incorrect Examples:
//
//&#8220;Yesterday, I had few reason to complain&#8221; should be, &#8220;Yesterday, I had little  reason  to complain.&#8221;
//&#8220;The teacher gave me few feedbacks on my paper&#8221; should be, &#8220;The teacher gave me little   feedback on my paper.&#8221;
//&#8220;I had a few bread for dinner&#8221; should be written as, &#8220;I had a few  slices of bread.&#8221;
//&#8220;She had little bathrooms in her house&#8221; means that the bathrooms themselves are small, not that she had a small number of bathrooms.
//The sentence, &#8220;She had few   bathrooms .&#8221; means that there are a small number of bathrooms.
//
//A little bit of
//"A little bit of" is informal and always precedes an  uncountable noun.
//
//"There is a little bit of pepper in the soup."
//"There is a little bit of snow on the ground."
//However, the example, &#8220;There is a little bit of  cards on the table&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work because card is a  countable noun. The correct phrasing would be, &#8220;There are a few  cards on the table.&#8221;
//
//Some/Any
//Both "some" and "any" can modify  countable and  uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is some  water on the floor."
//"There are some  people already here."
//"Do you have any   food ?"
//"Do you have any  apples ?"
//
//Even though &#8220;some&#8221; and &#8220;any&#8221; can modify both  countable and  uncountable nouns, both should be used with the plural form if there is one.
//
//For example, you wouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I have some cat at home.&#8221;
//The correct sentence is, &#8220;I have some  cats at home.&#8221;
//You also wouldn&#8217;t say, &#8220;Are there any apple on the table?&#8221;
//The correct sentence is, &#8220;Are there any  apples on the table?&#8221; Note that the verb and noun are both plural.
//
//Plenty of
//"Plenty of" modifies both  countable and  uncountable nouns.
//
//"They have plenty of money in the bank."
//"There are plenty of millionaires in Switzerland."
//
//Enough
//Enough modifies both  countable and  uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is enough money to buy a car."
//"I have enough books to read."
//
//No
//No modifies both  countable and  uncountable nouns.
//
//"There is no time to finish now."
//"There are no squirrels in the park."
//
