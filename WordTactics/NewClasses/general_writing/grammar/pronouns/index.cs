//Using Pronouns Clearly
// 
//Summary:
//This section has information about how to use pronouns correctly.
//
//Because a pronoun REFERS to a noun or TAKES THE PLACE OF that noun, you have to use the correct pronoun so that your reader clearly understands which noun your pronoun is referring to.
//Therefore, pronouns should:
//1. Agree in number
//If the pronoun takes the place of a singular noun, you have to use a singular pronoun.
// INCORRECT: The girls brought her umbrella.
// CORRECT: The girls brought their umbrella.
//NOTE: Some find the construction "his or her" wordy, so if it is possible to use a plural noun as your antecedent and thus use "they" as your pronoun, it may be wise to do so. If you do use a singular noun and the context makes the gender clear, then it is permissible to use just "his" or "her" rather than "his or her."
//NOTE ALSO: Recently, the use of "they" and "their" as singular pronouns has become more popular. This is due in part to the awkwardness of workarounds like "his or her" and in part to a broader cultural recognition that not all individuals identify themselves with the words "he" or "she." In fact, several official citation resources (including the the  Associated Press and the  Chicago Manual of Style) now include guidance on this kind of usage. See the OWL's page on the singular "they" for more information.
//2. Agree in person
//If you are writing in the first person (I), don't confuse your reader by switching to the second person (you) or third person (he, she, they, it, etc.). Similarly, if you are using the second person, don't switch to first or third.
// INCORRECT: When a person comes to class, you should have your homework ready.
// CORRECT: When a person comes to class, he or she should have his or her homework ready.
//3. Refer clearly to a specific noun.
//Don't be vague or ambiguous.
// INCORRECT: Although the motorcycle hit the tree, it was not damaged.
//(Is "it" the motorcycle or the tree?)
// INCORRECT: I don't think they should show violence on TV.
//(Who are "they"?)
// INCORRECT: Vacation is coming soon, which is nice.
//(What is nice, the vacation or the fact that it is coming soon?)
// INCORRECT: George worked in a national forest last summer. This may be his life's work.
//(What word does "this" refer to?)
// INCORRECT: If you put this sheet in your notebook, you can refer to it.
//(What does "it" refer to, the sheet or your notebook?)
