//Prepositions for Time, Place, and Introducing Objects
// 
//Summary:
//This section deals with prepositions and their standard uses.
//
//On prepositions
//Prepositions are keywords that indicate the start of a prepositional phrase. A prepositional phrase begins with the first preposition in the sentence and ends with the object or noun of the phrase. For example, &#8220;She sat on the red carpet while reading.&#8221; The italicized portion is a prepositional phrase. Generally, prepositional phrases act as adverbs or adjectives in that they modify either verbs, adverbs, or adjectives. This section will demonstrate how to use prepositions for time, place, and objects in American English.

//To express notions of place, English uses the following prepositions:

//On: to talk about the surface.
//At: to talk about a general vicinity.

//
//To introduce objects of verbs
//An object of a verb adds specificity to the verb. In terms of prepositional objects, the object is introduced by a preposition. For example, in the sentence, &#8220;They fought about the old chair,&#8221; which object did they fight over? The chair. When introducing objects of verbs, there are some prepositions that directly follow specific verbs. Below are some examples:
