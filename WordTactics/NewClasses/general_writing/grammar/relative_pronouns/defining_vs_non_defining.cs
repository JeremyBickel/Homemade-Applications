//Defining vs. Non-Defining and ESL Tips
// 
//Summary:
//This handout provides detailed rules and examples for the usage of relative pronouns (that, who, whom, whose, which, where, when, and why).
//
//Defining vs Non-Defining Clauses: Difference in Meaning
//There is a difference in meaning between defining and non-defining clauses that depends on the presence or absence of the comma. For example:
// They have two sons who are doctors.
//Defining clause; the meaning is that there are more sons in the family, e.g.:
// They have two sons who are doctors and one who is an architect.
//Compare:
// They have two sons, who are doctors.
//Non-defining clause; the meaning is that there are no more sons in the family.
//ESL Tips on the Use of Relative Pronouns
//Although there is no one single rule to cover all the cases, the following summary may be helpful if you need to make a quick decision:
//
//Use that if the main clause poses the question WHAT? answered by the relative clause;
//Do not use that presenting non-essential, additional information (that is, in non-defining relative clauses); use who or which instead;
//Use who to refer to people;
//Use which to refer to things or to refer to the previous clause as a whole;
//If you choose between who or that, use who in writing;
//If you choose between which and that, use which in writing;
//Do not put a comma before that.
