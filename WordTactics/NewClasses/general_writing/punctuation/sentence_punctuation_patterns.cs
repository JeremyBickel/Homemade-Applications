//Sentence Punctuation Patterns
// 
//Summary:
//This handout describes eight sentence punctuation patterns with examples.
//
//To punctuate a sentence, you can use and combine some of these patterns. For more information on independent and dependent clauses plus independent and dependent markers, see our handouts on those subjects.
//Pattern One: Simple sentence
//This pattern is an example of a simple sentence:
//Independent clause [ . ]
// Example: Doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma.
//Pattern Two : Compound Sentence
//This pattern is an example of a compound sentence with a coordinating conjunction:
//Independent clause [ , ] coordinating conjunction  independent clause [ . ]
//There are seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet.
// Example: Doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma, but they don't know the reasons for it.
//Pattern Three: Compound Sentence
//This pattern is an example of a compound sentence with a semicolon.
//Independent clause [ ; ] independent clause [ . ]
// Example: Doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma; they are unsure of its cause.
//Pattern Four: Compound Sentence
//This pattern is an example of a compound sentence with an independent marker.
//Independent clause [ ; ] independent marker [ , ] independent clause [ . ]
//Examples of independent markers are the following:  therefore, moreover, thus, consequently, however, also.
// Example: Doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma; therefore, they have called for more research into its causes.
//Pattern Five: Complex Sentence
//This pattern is an example of a complex sentence with a dependent marker.
//Dependent marker  dependent clause[ , ] Independent clause[ . ]
//Examples of dependent markers are as follows:  because, before, since, while, although, if, until, when, after, as, as if.
// Example:  Because  doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma, they have called for more research into its causes.
//Pattern Six: Complex Sentence
//This pattern is an example of a complex sentence with a dependent marker.
//Independent clause  dependent marker  dependent clause [ . ]
//Examples of dependent markers are as follows: because, before, since, while, although, if, until, when, after, as, as if.
// Example: Doctors are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma  because  it is a common, treatable illness.
//Pattern Seven
//This pattern includes an independent clause with an embedded non-essential clause or phrase
//First part of an independent clause [ , ]  non-essential clause or phrase,  rest of the independent clause  [ . ]
//A non-essential clause or phrase is one that can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence or making it ungrammatical. In other words, the non-essential clause or phrase gives additional information, but the sentence can stand alone without it.
// Example: Many doctors, including both pediatricians and family practice physicians, are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma.
//Pattern Eight
//This pattern includes an independent clause with an embedded essential clause or phrase
//First part of an independent clause   essential clause or phrase   rest of the independent clause [ . ]
//An essential clause or phrase is one that cannot be removed without changing the overall meaning of the sentence.
// Example: Many doctors  who are concerned about the rising death rate from asthma  have called for more research into its causes.
