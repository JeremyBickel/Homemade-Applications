//Commas vs. Semicolons in Compound Sentences
// 
//Summary:
//This resource offers a number of pages about comma use.
//
//For more information on semicolons, please see the "90-Second Semicolon" vidcast series on the Purdue OWL YouTube Channel.
//A group of words containing a subject and a verb and expressing a complete thought is called a sentence or an independent clause. Sometimes, an independent clause stands alone as a sentence, and sometimes two independent clauses are linked together into what is called a compound sentence. Depending on the circumstances, one of two different punctuation marks can be used between the independent clauses in a compound sentence: a comma or a semicolon. The choice is yours.
//Comma (,)
//Use a comma after the first independent clause when you link two independent clauses with one of the following coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet. For example:
// I am going home, and I intend to stay there.
// It rained heavily during the afternoon, but we managed to have our picnic anyway.
// They couldn't make it to the summit and back before dark, so they decided to camp for the night.
//Semicolon (;)
//Use a semicolon when you link two independent clauses with no connecting words. For example:
// I am going home; I intend to stay there.
// It rained heavily during the afternoon; we managed to have our picnic anyway.
// They couldn't make it to the summit and back before dark; they decided to camp for the night.
//You can also use a semicolon when you join two independent clauses together with one of the following conjunctive adverbs (adverbs that join independent clauses): however, moreover, therefore, consequently, otherwise, nevertheless, thus, etc. For example:
// I am going home; moreover, I intend to stay there.
// It rained heavily during the afternoon; however, we managed to have our picnic anyway.
// They couldn't make it to the summit and back before dark; therefore, they decided to camp for the night.
