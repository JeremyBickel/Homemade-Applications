//Identifying Independent and Dependent Clauses
// 
//Summary:
//This handout defines dependent and independent clauses and explores how they are treated in standard usage.
//
//When you want to use commas and semicolons in sentences and when you are concerned about whether a sentence is or is not a fragment, a good way to start is to be able to recognize dependent and independent clauses. The definitions offered here will help you with this.
//Independent Clause
//An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought. An independent clause is a sentence.
// Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz.
//Dependent Clause
//A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and verb but does not express a complete thought. A dependent clause cannot be a sentence. Often a dependent clause is marked by a dependent marker word.
// When Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz . . . (What happened when he studied? The thought is incomplete.)
//Dependent Marker Word
//A dependent marker word is a word added to the beginning of an independent clause that makes it into a dependent clause.
// When Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz, it was very noisy.
//Some common dependent markers: after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, if, in order to, since, though, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, and while.
//Connecting independent clauses
//There are two types of words that can be used as connectors at the beginning of an independent clause: coordinating conjunctions and independent marker words.
//1. Coordinating Conjunction
//The seven coordinating conjunctions used as connecting words at the beginning of an independent clause are and, but, for, or, nor, so, and yet. When the second independent clause in a sentence begins with a coordinating conjunction, a comma is needed before the coordinating conjunction:
// Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz, but it was hard to concentrate because of the noise.
//2. Independent Marker Word
//An independent marker word is a connecting word used at the beginning of an independent clause. These words can always begin a sentence that can stand alone. When the second independent clause in a sentence has an independent marker word, a semicolon is needed before the independent marker word.
// Jim studied in the Sweet Shop for his chemistry quiz; however, it was hard to concentrate because of the noise.
//Some common independent markers: also, consequently, furthermore, however, moreover, nevertheless, and therefore.
//Connecting dependent and independent clauses
//Subordinating conjunctions allow writers to construct complex sentences, which have an independent clause and a subordinate (or dependent) clause. Either clause can come first.
// The students acted differently whenever a substitute taught the class.
// Whenever a substitute taught the class, the students acted differently.
//Note that the clauses are separated with a comma when the dependent clause comes first.
//Some common subordinating conjunctions: after, as, before, once, since, until, and while.
//Some Common Errors to Avoid
//Comma Splices
//A comma splice is the use of a comma between two independent clauses. You can usually fix the error by changing the comma to a period and therefore making the two clauses into two separate sentences, by changing the comma to a semicolon, or by making one clause dependent by inserting a dependent marker word in front of it.
// Incorrect: I like this class, it is very interesting.
// 
//
//Correct: I like this class. It is very interesting.
//(or) I like this class; it is very interesting.
//(or) I like this class, and it is very interesting.
//(or) I like this class because it is very interesting.
//(or) Because it is very interesting, I like this class.
//
//
//Fused Sentences
//Fused sentences happen when there are two independent clauses not separated by any form of punctuation. This error is also known as a run-on sentence. The error can sometimes be corrected by adding a period, semicolon, or colon to separate the two sentences.
// Incorrect: My professor is intelligent I've learned a lot from her.
// 
//
//Correct: My professor is intelligent. I've learned a lot from her.
//(or) My professor is intelligent; I've learned a lot from her.
//(or) My professor is intelligent, and I've learned a lot from her.
//(or) My professor is intelligent; moreover, I've learned a lot from her.
//
//
//Sentence Fragments
//Sentence fragments happen by treating a dependent clause or other incomplete thought as a complete sentence. You can usually fix this error by combining it with another sentence to make a complete thought or by removing the dependent marker.
// Incorrect: Because I forgot the exam was today.
// 
//
//Correct: Because I forgot the exam was today, I didn't study.
//(or) I forgot the exam was today.
