Or, you may write a company newsletter in order to inform others about current events and employee happenings.

//Introduction
//While newsletters may be written for a number of reasons, they all have the same purpose. Newsletters are written to inform their readership of relevant happenings that have recently taken place and/or that may be taking place in the future. One of the most important considerations when writing a newsletter, regardless of reason for writing them, is to keep your audience in mind. This may impact not only the language that is use, but also the actual content of the newsletter.

//Tips for Writing Successful Newsletters
//
//Audience Matters - When writing a newsletter, it is important to keep your audience in mind. This will impact the information that you choose to include. Make sure that your audience has some potential interest in the content of the newsletter.
//Length - The newsletter should be concise. Think of it in terms of a news flash. You want your audience to be able to quickly and efficiently grasp the information you are presenting.
//Content - The content of the newsletter should present reliable information. Even if it is just a personal holiday newsletter. It is best to avoid hearsay. This can be done by conducting interviews with persons of interest, or inviting these people to write their own newsletter article. You can also invite them to just send their main points, or to respond to a few questions.
//Visuals - It is important to keep in mind that the content and efficacy of the newsletter is not solely dependent on the written information. The visual channel matters too. Include meaningful photos, such as a lively picture of the person you interviewed. It is best not to use generic stock photos or clip art.
//Formatting - When formatting a newsletter, a simple one column design is not the most efficient way to present the content. Make use of multiple columns on the same page to make a more visually impactful presentation, keeping in mind that you don't want to break information down into too many columns. It's best to think of how readers read. For more information on visual rhetoric and design, click here.
//Fonts- Multiple fonts can help to visually distinguish information. However, it's best to use only two fonts from different families, one serif and one sans-serif. Use one font for headings and another for body text.
//Editing- Even if your audience is just your family, make sure that you devote some time to proofread and to edit your newsletter. Don't hesitate to ask a colleague, a friend, or a family member to take a look at your newsletter and to offer their feedback.
