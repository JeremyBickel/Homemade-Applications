//Personal Letters
//Personal letters are used in certain contexts as a means of personal communication. This may include, but is not limited to, letters of complaint and holiday letters. Personal letters, when compared to emails, may give the reader a stronger feeling of personal connection with the author.
//Newsletters
//Newsletters can be written for a number of contexts and events, but their primary purpose is always to inform the reader. For example, you may write a holiday newsletter to inform friends and family about what has happened in your immediate family in the past year. Or, you may write a company newsletter in order to inform others about current events and employee happenings.
