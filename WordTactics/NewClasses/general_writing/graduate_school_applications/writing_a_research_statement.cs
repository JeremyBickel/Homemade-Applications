//Graduate School Applications: Writing a Research Statement
// 
//Summary:
//The research statement is a common component of a potential candidate&#8217;s application for post-undergraduate study. This may include applications for graduate programs, post-doctoral fellowships, or faculty positions. The research statement is often the primary way that a committee determines if a candidate&#8217;s interests and past experience make them a good fit for their program/institution.
//
//What is a Research Statement?
//A research statement is a short document that provides a brief history of your past research experience, the current state of your research, and the future work you intend to complete.

//What Should It Look Like?
//Research statements are generally one to two single-spaced pages. You should be sure to thoroughly read and follow the length and content requirements for each individual application.
//Your research statement should situate your work within the larger context of your field and show how your works contributes to, complicates, or counters other work being done. It should be written for an audience of other professionals in your field.
//What Should It Include?
//Your statement should start by articulating the broader field that you are working within and the larger question or questions that you are interested in answering. It should then move to articulate your specific interest.
//The body of your statement should include a brief history of your past research. What questions did you initially set out to answer in your research project? What did you find? How did it contribute to your field? (i.e. did it lead to academic publications, conferences, or collaborations?). How did your past research propel you forward?
//It should also address your present research. What questions are you actively trying to solve? What have you found so far? How are you connecting your research to the larger academic conversation? (i.e. do you have any publications under review, upcoming conferences, or other professional engagements?) What are the larger implications of your work?
//Finally, it should describe the future trajectory on which you intend to take your research. What further questions do you want to solve? How do you intend to find answers to these questions? How can the institution to which you are applying help you in that process? What are the broader implications of your potential results?
//Note: Make sure that the research project that you propose can be completed at the institution to which you are applying.
//Other Considerations:
//
//Make sure that your statement is clearly tied together. Show a progression.
//
//What is the primary question that you have tried to address over the course of your academic career? Why is this question important to the field? How has each stage of your work related to that question?
//
//
//
//
//Include a few specific examples that show your success. What tangible solutions have you found to the question that you were trying to answer? How have your solutions impacted the larger field? Examples can include references to published findings, conference presentations, or other professional involvement.
//Be confident about your skills and abilities. The research statement is your opportunity to sell yourself to an institution. Show that you are self-motivated and passionate about your project.
