//Punctuation Marks for Achieving Emphasis
// 
//Summary:
//This handout provides information on visual and textual devices for adding emphasis to your writing including textual formatting, punctuation, sentence structure, and the arrangement of words.
//
//Some punctuation marks prompt the reader to give a word or sentence more than usual emphasis. For example, a command with a period does not evoke the same emphatic response as the same command with an exclamation mark.
// Watch out!
//A dash or colon has more emphatic force than a comma.
// 
//The employees were surprised by the decision, which was not to change company policy.
//The employees were surprised by the decision&#8212;no change in company policy.
//The employees were surprised by the decision: no change in company policy.
