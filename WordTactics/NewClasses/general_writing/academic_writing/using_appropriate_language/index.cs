//Appropriate Language: Overview
// 
//Summary:
//This handout will cover some of the major issues with appropriate language use: levels of language formality, deceitful language and euphemisms, slang and idiomatic expressions; using group-specific jargon; and biased/stereotypical language.
//
//When writing, it is very important to use language that fits your audience and matches purpose. Inappropriate language uses can damage your credibility, undermine your argument, or alienate your audience. This handout will cover some of the major issues with appropriate language use: levels of language formality, deceitful language and euphemisms, slang and idiomatic expressions; using group-specific jargon; and biased/stereotypical language.
//The following is a short overview of the different aspects of using appropriate language. Review the other sections of this handout for a more complete discussion.
//
//Levels of formality: Writing in a style that your audience expects and that fits your purpose is key to successful writing.
//In-Group jargon: Jargon refers to specialized language used by groups of like-minded individuals. Only use in-group jargon when you are writing for members of that group. You should never use jargon for a general audience without first explaining it.
//Slang and idiomatic expressions: Avoid using slang or idiomatic expressions in general academic writing.
//Deceitful language and euphemisms: Avoid using euphemisms (words that veil the truth, such as "collateral damage" for the unintended destruction of civilians and their property) and other deceitful language.
//Biased language: Avoid using biased language including language with a racial, ethnic, group, or gender bias or language that is stereotypical.
