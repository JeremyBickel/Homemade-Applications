//Organizing Your Argument
// 
//Summary:
//This page summarizes three historical methods for argumentation, providing structural templates for each.
//
//How can I effectively present my argument?
//In order for your argument to be persuasive, it must use an organizational structure that the audience perceives as both logical and easy to parse. Three argumentative methods&#8212;the&#160;Toulmin Method, Classical Method, and Rogerian Method&#8212;give guidance for how to organize the points in an argument.
//Note that these are only three of the most popular models for organizing an argument. Alternatives exist. Be sure to consult your instructor and/or defer to your assignment&#8217;s directions if you&#8217;re unsure which to use (if any).
//Toulmin Method
//The&#160;Toulmin Method&#160;is a formula that allows writers to build a sturdy logical foundation for their arguments. First proposed by author Stephen Toulmin in&#160;The Uses of Argument (1958), the Toulmin Method emphasizes building a thorough support structure for each of an argument's key claims.
//The basic format for the Toulmin Method&#160;is as follows:
//Claim:&#160;In this section, you explain your overall thesis on the subject. In other words, you make your main argument.
//Data (Grounds):&#160;You should use evidence to support the claim. In other words, provide the reader with facts that prove your argument is strong.
//Warrant (Bridge):&#160;In this section, you explain why or how your data supports the claim. As a result, the underlying assumption that you build your argument on is grounded in reason.
//Backing (Foundation):&#160;Here, you provide any additional logic or reasoning that may be necessary to support the warrant.
//Counterclaim:&#160;You should anticipate a counterclaim that negates the main points in your argument. Don't avoid arguments that oppose your own. Instead, become familiar with the opposing perspective. &#160;If you respond to counterclaims, you appear unbiased (and, therefore, you earn the respect of your readers). You may even want to include several counterclaims to show that you have thoroughly researched the topic.
//Rebuttal:&#160;In this section, you incorporate your own evidence that disagrees with the counterclaim. It is essential to include a thorough warrant or bridge to strengthen your essay&#8217;s argument. If you present data to your audience without explaining how it supports your thesis, your readers may not make a connection between the two, or they may draw different conclusions.
//Example of the Toulmin Method: 
//Claim:&#160;Hybrid cars are an effective strategy to fight pollution.
//Data1:&#160;Driving a private car is a typical citizen's most air-polluting activity.
//Warrant 1:&#160;Due to the fact that cars are the largest source of private (as opposed to industrial) air pollution, switching to hybrid cars should have an impact on fighting pollution.
//Data 2:&#160;Each vehicle produced is going to stay on the road for roughly 12 to 15 years.
//Warrant 2:&#160;Cars generally have a long lifespan, meaning that the decision to switch to a hybrid car will make a long-term impact on pollution levels.
//Data 3:&#160;Hybrid cars combine a gasoline engine with a battery-powered electric motor.
//Warrant 3:&#160;The combination of these technologies produces less pollution.
//Counterclaim:&#160;Instead of focusing on cars, which still encourages an inefficient culture of driving even as it cuts down on pollution, the nation should focus on building and encouraging the use of mass transit systems.
//Rebuttal:&#160;While mass transit is an idea that should be encouraged, it is not feasible in many rural and suburban areas, or for people who must commute to work. Thus, hybrid cars are a better solution for much of the nation's population.
//Rogerian Method
//The Rogerian Method&#160;(named for, but not developed by, influential American psychotherapist Carl R. Rogers)&#160;is a popular method for controversial issues. This strategy seeks to find a common ground between parties by making the audience understand perspectives that stretch beyond (or even run counter to) the writer&#8217;s position. Moreso than other methods, it places an emphasis on reiterating an opponent's argument to his or her satisfaction. The persuasive power of the Rogerian Method lies in its ability to define the terms of the argument in such a way that:
//
//your position seems like a reasonable compromise.
//you seem compassionate and empathetic.
//
//The basic format of the Rogerian Method&#160;is as follows:
//Introduction:&#160;Introduce the issue to the audience, striving to remain as objective as possible.
//Opposing View: Explain the other side&#8217;s position in an unbiased way. When you discuss the counterargument without judgement, the opposing side can see how you do not directly dismiss perspectives which conflict with your stance.
//Statement of Validity (Understanding):&#160;This section discusses how you acknowledge how the other side&#8217;s points can be valid under certain circumstances. You identify how and why their perspective makes sense in a specific context, but still present your own argument.
//Statement of Your Position:&#160;By this point, you have demonstrated that you understand the other side&#8217;s viewpoint. In this section, you explain your own stance.
//Statement of Contexts: Explore scenarios in which your position has merit. When you explain how your argument is most appropriate for certain contexts, the reader can recognize that you acknowledge the multiple ways to view the complex issue.
//Statement of Benefits:&#160;You should conclude by explaining to the opposing side why they would benefit from accepting your position. By explaining the advantages of your argument, you close on a positive note without completely dismissing the other side&#8217;s perspective.
//Example of the Rogerian Method:
//Introduction:&#160;The issue of whether children should wear school uniforms is subject to some debate.
//Opposing View:&#160;Some parents think that requiring children to wear uniforms is best.
//Statement of Validity (Understanding):&#160;Those parents who support uniforms argue that, when all students wear the same uniform, the students can develop a unified sense of school pride and inclusiveness.
//Statement of Your Position: Students should not be required to wear school uniforms. Mandatory uniforms would forbid choices that allow students to be creative and express themselves through clothing.
//Statement of Contexts:&#160;However, even if uniforms might hypothetically promote inclusivity, in most real-life contexts, administrators can use uniform policies to enforce conformity. Students should have the option to explore their identity through clothing without the fear of being ostracized.
//Statement of Benefits:&#160;Though both sides seek to promote students' best interests, students should not be required to wear school uniforms. By giving students freedom over their choice, students can explore their self-identity by choosing how to present themselves to their peers.
//Classical Method
//The Classical Method of structuring an argument is another common way to organize your points. Originally devised by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (and then later developed by Roman thinkers like Cicero and Quintilian), classical arguments tend to focus on issues of definition and the careful application of evidence. Thus, the underlying assumption of classical argumentation is that, when all parties understand the issue perfectly, the correct course of action will be clear.
//The basic format of the Classical Method&#160;is as follows:
//Introduction (Exordium): Introduce the issue and explain its significance. You should also establish your credibility and the topic&#8217;s legitimacy.
//Statement of Background (Narratio): Present vital contextual or historical information to the audience to further their understanding of the issue. By doing so, you provide the reader with a working knowledge about the topic independent of your own stance.
//Proposition (Propositio): After you provide the reader with contextual knowledge, you are ready to state your claims which relate to the information you have provided previously. This section outlines your major points for the reader.
//Proof (Confirmatio): You should explain your reasons and evidence to the reader. Be sure to thoroughly justify your reasons. In this section, if necessary, you can provide supplementary evidence and subpoints.
//Refutation (Refuatio): In this section, you address anticipated counterarguments that disagree with your thesis. Though you acknowledge the other side&#8217;s perspective, it is important to prove why your stance is more logical.&#160; 
//Conclusion (Peroratio): You should summarize your main points. The conclusion also caters to the reader&#8217;s emotions and values. The use of pathos here makes the reader more inclined to consider your argument. &#160;
//Example of the Classical Method:&#160; 
//Introduction (Exordium): Millions of workers are paid a set hourly wage nationwide. The federal minimum wage is standardized to protect workers from being paid too little. Research points to many viewpoints on how much to pay these workers. Some families cannot afford to support their households on the current wages provided for performing a minimum wage job.
//Statement of Background (Narratio): Currently, millions of American workers struggle to make ends meet on a minimum wage. This puts a strain on workers&#8217; personal and professional lives. Some work multiple jobs to provide for their families.
//Proposition (Propositio): The current federal minimum wage should be increased to better accommodate millions of overworked Americans. By raising the minimum wage, workers can spend more time cultivating their livelihoods.
//Proof (Confirmatio): According to the United States Department of Labor, 80.4 million Americans work for an hourly wage, but nearly 1.3 million receive wages less than the federal minimum. The pay raise will alleviate the stress of these workers. Their lives would benefit from this raise because it affects multiple areas of their lives.
//Refutation (Refuatio): There is some evidence that raising the federal wage might increase the cost of living. However, other evidence contradicts this or suggests that the increase would not be great. Additionally,&#160; worries about a cost of living increase must be balanced with the benefits of providing necessary funds to millions of hardworking Americans.
//Conclusion (Peroratio):If the federal minimum wage was raised, many workers could alleviate some of their financial burdens. As a result, their emotional wellbeing would improve overall. Though some argue that the cost of living could increase, the benefits outweigh the potential drawbacks.
