//Paramedic Method: A Lesson in Writing Concisely
// 
//Summary:
//This handout provides steps and exercises to eliminate wordiness at the sentence level.
//
//Use the Paramedic Method (originally developed by Richard Lanham in Revising Prose) to edit any kind of professional writing. Editing your professional writing using the Paramedic Method will make your prose easier to read. Sentences that are easy to read are more persuasive and more user-centered.
//Professional writers understand the need for clear, concise prose. An industry standard for helping workplace writers achieve user-centered, persuasive, and clear prose is the Paramedic Method. When you use the Paramedic Method, you will reduce your word count by eliminating unnecessary words. The Paramedic Method also helps you activate your sentences by eliminating passive voice and redundancies. The Paramedic Method is an easy to learn, systematic way to make your sentences more persuasive and more user-centered.
//Follow the seven steps below to improve the readability of your sentences.

//Move the doer into the subject (Who's kicking whom)
//Eliminate any unnecessary slow wind-ups
//Eliminate any redundancies.
//
