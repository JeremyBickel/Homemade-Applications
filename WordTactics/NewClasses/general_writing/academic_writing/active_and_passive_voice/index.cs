//Active and Passive Voice
// 
//Summary:
//This handout will explain the difference between active and passive voice in writing. It gives examples of both, and shows how to turn a passive sentence into an active one. Also, it explains how to decide when to choose passive voice instead of active.
//
//Using Active Versus Passive Voice
//In a sentence using active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action expressed in the verb.
// 
// 
//The arrow points from the subject performing the action (the dog) to the individual being acted upon (the boy). This is an example of a sentence using the active voice.
//
//
// 
// 
//Sample active voice sentence with the subject performing the action described by the verb.
//

//

//Each example above includes a sentence subject performing the action expressed by the verb.
