//Narrative Essays
// 
//Summary:
//The Modes of Discourse&#8212;Exposition, Description, Narration, Argumentation (EDNA)&#8212;are common paper assignments you may encounter in your writing classes. Although these genres have been criticized by some composition scholars, the Purdue OWL recognizes the widespread use of these approaches and students&#8217; need to understand and produce them.
//
//What is a narrative essay?
//When writing a narrative essay, one might think of it as telling a story. These essays are often anecdotal, experiential, and personal&#8212;allowing students to express themselves in a creative and, quite often, moving ways.
//Here are some guidelines for writing a narrative essay.
//
//If written as a story, the essay should include all the parts of a story.
//
//This means that you must include an introduction, plot, characters, setting, climax, and conclusion.
//
//When would a narrative essay not be written as a story?
//
//A good example of this is when an instructor asks a student to write a book report. Obviously, this would not necessarily follow the pattern of a story and would focus on providing an informative narrative for the reader.
//
//The essay should have a purpose.
//
//Make a point! Think of this as the thesis of your story. If there is no point to what you are narrating, why narrate it at all?
//
//The essay should be written from a clear point of view.
//
//It is quite common for narrative essays to be written from the standpoint of the author; however, this is not the sole perspective to be considered. Creativity in narrative essays oftentimes manifests itself in the form of authorial perspective.
//
//Use clear and concise language throughout the essay.
//
//Much like the descriptive essay, narrative essays are effective when the language is carefully, particularly, and artfully chosen. Use specific language to evoke specific emotions and senses in the reader.
//
//The use of the first person pronoun &#8216;I&#8217; is welcomed.
//
//Do not abuse this guideline! Though it is welcomed it is not necessary&#8212;nor should it be overused for lack of clearer diction.
//
//As always, be organized!
//
//Have a clear introduction that sets the tone for the remainder of the essay. Do not leave the reader guessing about the purpose of your narrative. Remember, you are in control of the essay, so guide it where you desire (just make sure your audience can follow your lead).
