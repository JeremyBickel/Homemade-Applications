//What is diction?
//Diction&#160;refers to word choice&#8212;choosing the right word for the right situation, which&#160;can set the scene or evoke a particular mood&#160;in writing.&#160;Diction&#160;can tell you something about a writer&#8217;s attitude towards a subject (or even their readers), their background and interests, where they grew up, or how they see themselves. It can make a piece of writing simple and pleasing to read&#8212;or difficult and boring.&#160;&#160;
//Determining the &#8220;right&#8221; word&#160;for a given situation&#160;involves understanding its&#160;denotation, or dictionary definition, and its&#160;connotation, or the subtler meanings a word can pick up in certain contexts. Authors also&#160;have to&#160;consider what they want the text to achieve, and what readers will want.&#160;
