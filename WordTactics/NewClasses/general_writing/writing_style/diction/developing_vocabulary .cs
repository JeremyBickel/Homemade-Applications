//Another simple but effective way of finding the right word is to think about subtle differences between synonyms.&#160;While writing, if you&#160;don&#8217;t&#160;know a synonym for a word, you can look it up in a&#160;thesaurus. Similarly,&#160;for&#160;many&#160;word&#160;processing programs, you can right-click on a word to find synonyms.&#160;If you need more inspiration, you can continue looking through entries for different words until you find the right one.&#160;&#160;
//In general, reading broadly is a strong strategy for developing and expanding&#160;one&#8217;s&#160;vocabulary;&#160;reading&#160;texts similar in style and purpose can help one gain a better sense of what diction &#8220;works&#8221; in that context.&#160;Oftentimes, this search for the &#8220;perfect word&#8221; is a matter of understanding how small distinctions in meaning and connotation can contribute to a larger mood or&#160;tone, or&#160;give the audience more specific details.&#160;
//For example, dialogue is a common feature in narrative writing, so many creative writers will try to find synonyms for the word &#8220;said&#8221; to avoid monotony and repetition. If every dialogue scene sounded like, &#8220;He said, she said, they said,&#8221; the reader would&#160;get&#160;bored&#160;fairly quickly, and they would miss&#160;important&#160;details&#160;about how the character is speaking&#160;and&#160;what&#160;they&#8217;re&#160;feeling. For this reason, many writers will use more specific dialogue tags (words used to &#8220;tag&#8221; or introduce a quote) that explain&#160;the type of speaking&#8212;for example, instead of &#8220;said,&#8221; writers can use &#8220;asked,&#8221; &#8220;replied,&#8221;&#160;&#8220;yelled,&#8221; &#8220;cried,&#8221; &#8220;whispered,&#8221; and so on.&#160;&#160;
//And within these categories, there are further and even more specific synonyms. Consider how&#160;&#8220;queried,&#8221; &#8220;interrogated,&#8221; &#8220;wondered,&#8221; or &#8220;inquired&#8221;&#160;each mean something slightly different and more specific than the&#160;more general &#8220;asked.&#8221;&#160;Using specific and interesting diction where&#160;appropriate can&#160;help&#160;readers&#160;&#160;better&#160;understand&#160;&#160;enjoy&#160;the piece&#160;they&#8217;re&#160;reading.&#160;
