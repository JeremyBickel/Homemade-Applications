//Levels of Diction
//There are&#160;different levels of diction&#160;that&#160;are important for clarifying an author&#8217;s audience and purpose.&#160;Generally,&#160;rhetoricians&#160;recognize three levels:&#160;high, middle, and low. While these terms survive from the ancient Romans, they still work well today.&#160;&#160;
//
//&#8220;High&#8221; diction can be thought of as formal or elevated: the sort of language used in research papers or formal speeches, for example.&#160;&#160;
//&#8220;Middle&#8221; diction is&#160;essentially neutral; that is, it&#160;isn&#8217;t&#160;especially formal or informal, and it can be used in a variety of settings to reach a broad audience. Essays and newspaper articles are examples of language that might use middle diction.&#160;&#160;
//&#8220;Low&#8221; diction refers to informal language, especially slang or&#160;colloquial&#160;speech. Magazine blurbs, casual social media posts, and texts to friends are all examples of this level of diction.&#160;
