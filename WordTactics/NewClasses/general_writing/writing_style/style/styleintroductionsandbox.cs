//What is style?
//Style&#160;refers&#160;to how&#160;someone expresses themselves in writing&#8212;in other words,&#160;what makes their writing sound like them.&#160;Just like how&#160;someone&#160;might&#160;choose clothes based on&#160;their&#160;mood,&#160;the weather,&#160;or the persona&#160;they&#8217;d like to convey, style allows writers to&#160;adopt&#160;a particular &#8220;aesthetic&#8221;&#160;tailored&#160;to their purpose,&#160;context,&#160;and personality.&#160;&#160;
//The two main building blocks of style are diction and syntax:&#160;&#160;
//
//Diction&#160;refers&#160;to word choice. A writer might&#160;choose a certain word based on its&#160;denotation&#8212;its dictionary definition&#8212;or its&#160;connotation&#8212;the &#8220;slang&#8221; or&#160;implied&#160;meaning a word can pick up in certain contexts.&#160;&#160;
//Syntax&#160;refers to sentence structure. The length and complexity of sentences are matters of syntax, as are the ways that&#160;different clauses are arranged and how they flow.&#160;Choosing different kinds of syntax&#160;allows writers to&#160;manipulate the qualities of&#160;rhythm and coherence throughout&#160;a piece of&#160;writing.&#160;While they&#160;aren&#8217;t the only&#160;methods&#160;writers have for creating their own style, diction and syntax&#160;are powerful tools for establishing the persona they wish to present to their audience.&#160;
