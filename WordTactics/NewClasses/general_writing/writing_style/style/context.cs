//Context
//Style is contextual, meaning that it is determined by the media of writing and publication, the author&#8217;s aims, and the intended audience. Using casual or simple language in a formal document would be inappropriate, for instance, because it might give the audience the impression that the author doesn&#8217;t fully understand the&#160;importance of the work, that they don&#8217;t take the audience seriously,&#160;or that they simply don&#8217;t have a very extensive vocabulary&#160;(which could affect their&#160;ethos, or credibility).&#160;Conversely, a&#160;social media post from a&#160;prominent&#160;political figure might&#160;demand&#160;a certain level of&#160;seriousness or&#160;decorum. When taking context into account, a writer needs to consider not only what they would like to say and how, but also what their audience needs and wants to get from the text.&#160;
//Mood, Tone, and Pathos&#160;
//Style allows writers to create mood and evoke feeling in readers.&#160;Mood&#160;refers to a writing&#8217;s atmosphere, and can be influenced by the writer&#8217;s attitude, or their&#160;tone. For example, Edgar Allen Poe&#8217;s stories and poetry often have a somber or eerie mood, whereas Jane Austen&#8217;s novels display her sense of&#160;wit.&#160;&#160;
//Mood and tone work together to help create&#160;pathos,&#160;or&#160;emotions.&#160;As part of the rhetorical triangle, along with&#160;logos&#160;(logic) and ethos,&#160;pathos allows for genuine human connection and helps inform the audience&#8217;s attitudes and decisions.&#160;In fact, some treatises on Classical rhetoric, like&#160;Longinus&#8217;&#160;On&#160;The&#160;Sublime, argue that pathos is the most important aspect of the rhetorical triangle for this reason. But no matter how one ranks&#160;the elements&#160;of the rhetorical triangle, the ability to evoke emotion in an audience is a hallmark of strong stylistic writing.&#160;
