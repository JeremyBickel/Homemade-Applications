//Using Models&#160;
//One way to develop style as a writer is to read broadly and practice writing often. Make note of what you like&#160;and what you don&#8217;t.&#160;Analyze what makes that style&#160;work and&#160;try applying it in your own writing. You&#8217;ll find as you experiment that some styles sound like you, and some don&#8217;t, and that some styles work better in some situations than others. The important thing to remember is that writing is a craft. It takes practice and diligence, much like music, visual arts, and sports. Just as no one is born a concert pianist, but rather&#160;rises&#160;to that level of talent and prestige through training,&#160;so too&#160;is&#160;no one born a&#160;perfect writer.&#160;
