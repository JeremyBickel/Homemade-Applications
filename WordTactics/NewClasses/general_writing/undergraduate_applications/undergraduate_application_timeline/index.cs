//Undergraduate Application Timeline
// 
//Summary:
//The resources in this section provide a general timeline for undergraduate applications. In this section you will also find more detailed information about each stage in the application process.
//
//Timeline
//Although this is a general timeline, you will need to be mindful of each individual school&#8217;s admissions deadlines. Some request that materials be turned in before the end of the year, some after, and others even have rolling admission deadlines that go until March. However, keep in mind that applying closer to these later deadlines may necessarily mean that your application will be judged not only according to your merits but also to the space available at that point in the process. So, if you think you might be interested in applying to a school down the line, apply early.
