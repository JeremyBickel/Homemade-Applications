        //Three rules:
        //1) Modifies Nouns
        //2) Always follows a form of the verb to be when it modifies the noun before the verb.  Examples: I was nervous. She has been sick all week. They tried to be helpful.
        //3) Always follows a sense verb or a verb of appearance when it modifies the noun before the verb. These adjectives will most often follow a verb form of the following: be, feel, taste, smell, sound, look, appear, and seem.  Example: Sharon's cough sounds bad. ["bad" is an adjective that modifies "cough"; using the adverb "badly" would mean her cough isn't very good at sounding] Castor oil tastes awful. ["awful" is an adjective that modifies "oil"] The ocean air smells fresh. ["fresh" is an adjective that modifies "air"] She seems unhappy today. ["unhappy" modifies "she"] This apple smells sweet. [the adjective "sweet" modifies "apple", the noun] Your dog smells carefully. [the adverb "carefully" modifies "smells", the verb]

        //What kind of information do adjectives give?
        //1) A more detailed sense of the noun. Example: "I ate a meal." versus "I ate an enormous meal."
        //2) Clarity about the noun concerning three questions: What kind, Which, and How many.

        //Common Errors:
        //Bad or Badly? When you want to describe how you feel, you should use an adjective (Why? Feel is a sense verb;see rule #3 above). So you'd say, "I feel bad." Saying you feel badly would be like saying you play football badly. It would mean that you are unable to feel, as though your hands were partially numb.
        //Good or Well? Good is an adjective, so you do not do good or live good, but you do well and live well. Remember, though, that an adjective follows sense-verbs and be-verbs, so you also feel good, look good, smell good, are good, have been good, etc. (Refer to rule #3 above for more information about sense verbs and verbs of appearance.) Confusion can occur because well can function either as an adverb or an adjective. When well is used as an adjective, it means "not sick" or "in good health." For this specific sense of well, it's OK to say you feel well or are well — for example, after recovering from an illness. When not used in this health-related sense, however, well functions as an adverb; for example, "I did well on my exam."
        //Double-negatives: Scarcely and hardly are already negative adverbs. To add another negative term is redundant, because in English only one negative is ever used at a time. They found scarcely any animals on the island. (not scarcely no...) Hardly anyone came to the party. (not hardly no one...)
        //Sure or Surely? Sure is an adjective, and surely is an adverb. Sure is also used in the idiomatic expression sure to be. Surely can be used as a sentence-adverb. Here are some examples that show different uses of sure and surely. Adjectives are in blue and adverbs are in red. Examples: I am sure that you were there. [Here sure is an adjective that modifies the pronoun I.] He is surely ready to take on the project. [Here surely is an adverb that modifies the adjective ready.] She is sure to be a great leader. [Here sure to be is an idiomatic phrase that functions as an adjective that modifies the pronoun she.] Surely, environmental destruction has been one of the worst catastrophes brought about by industrial production. [Here surely is an adverb that modifies the verb has been.]
        //Real or Really? Real is an adjective, and really is an adverb. Here are some examples that demonstrate the difference between real and really. Examples: She did really well on that test. [Here really is an adverb that modifies the adverb well.] Is she really going out with him? [Here really is an adverb that modifies the verb phrase going out.] Popular culture proposes imaginary solutions to real problems. [Here real is an adjective that modifies the noun problems.]
        //Near or Nearly? Near can function as a verb, adverb, adjective, or preposition. Nearly is used as an adverb to mean "in a close manner" or "almost but not quite." Here are some examples that demonstrate the differences between various uses of near and nearly. Examples: The moment of truth neared. [Here neared is a verb in the past tense.] We are nearly finished with this project. [Here nearly is an adverb that modifies the verb finished.] The cat crept near. [Here near is an adverb of place that modifies the verb crept.] First cousins are more nearly related than second cousins. [Here nearly is an adverb that modifies the verb related.] The detective solves the mystery in a scene near the end of the movie. [Here near is a preposition. The prepositional phrase near the end of the movie modifies the noun scene.]

        //Countability matters with some (but not all) adjectives.
        //much [uncountable]
        //many [countable]
        //a lot of [follows the rule for "much" and "many" when they are used to mean those words]
        //lots of [follows the rule for "much" and "many" when they are used to mean those words]
        //little [uncountable]
        //few [countable]
        //a little bit of [uncountable]
        //some [can modify countable and uncountable, but when it means "amount" it should be used with plural nouns if they are available; when this adjective is a general differntiation term, it can be used with singular and plural nouns - example: I have some cats. [amount] I have some cat (out of many cats to choose from). [differentiation]]
        //any [can modify countable and uncountable, but when it means "amount" it should be used with plural nouns if they are available; when this adjective is a general differntiation term, it can be used with singular and plural nouns - example: Do you have any cats? [amount] Do you have any cat from that litter (out of many cats to choose from?) [differentiation]]
        //plenty of [both countable and uncountable]
        //enough [both countable and uncountable]
        //no [both countable and uncountable]
