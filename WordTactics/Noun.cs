        //Countable nouns can bear the plural "s" and take a preceding number, like "two cats"
        //Uncountable nouns only take the singular, unless they are used as countable nouns. Example: She has beautiful skin. The hull of a kayak is made of animal skins.

        //Article use with countable and uncountable nouns

        //Countable Singular - "A", "An", "The"
        //Countable Plural - "The" modifies specific nouns, [No Article] modifies general nouns

        //Examples:
        //The guest of honor arrived late.
        //You are welcome as a guest in our home.
        //The guests at your party yesterday made a lot of noise.
        //Guests are welcome here anytime.

        //Uncountable - "The" modifies specific nouns, [Singular Verb] 

        //Examples:
        //Information is a precious commodity in our computerized world.
        //The information in your files is correct.
        //Sugar has become more expensive recently.
        //Please pass me the sugar.
