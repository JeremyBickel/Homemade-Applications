60752 ^ 1 ^ and cometh not again
60753 ^ 1 ^ did they provoke
60754 ^ 1 ^ him in the wilderness
60755 ^ 1 ^ and grieve
60756 ^ 1 ^ him in the desert
60757 ^ 1 ^ yea they turned back
60758 ^ 1 ^ and limited

60760 ^ 1 ^ and had turned
60761 ^ 1 ^ and their floods
60762 ^ 1 ^ among them which devoured
60763 ^ 1 ^ them and frogs
60764 ^ 1 ^ which destroyed
60765 ^ 1 ^ also their increase
60766 ^ 1 ^ unto the caterpillar
60767 ^ 1 ^ and their labor
60768 ^ 1 ^ unto the locust
60769 ^ 1 ^ with hail
60770 ^ 1 ^ and their sycamore trees
60771 ^ 1 ^ with frost
60772 ^ 1 ^ he gave up
60773 ^ 1 ^ also to the hail
60774 ^ 1 ^ to hot thunderbolts
60775 ^ 1 ^ upon them the fierceness
60776 ^ 1 ^ and indignation
60777 ^ 1 ^ by sending
60778 ^ 1 ^ to his anger
60779 ^ 1 ^ he spared
60780 ^ 1 ^ but gave
60781 ^ 1 ^ over to the pestilence
60782 ^ 1 ^ in the tabernacles
60783 ^ 1 ^ but made his own people
60784 ^ 1 ^ them on safely
60785 ^ 1 ^ so that they feared
60786 ^ 1 ^ but the sea
60787 ^ 1 ^ even to this
60788 ^ 1 ^ which his right hand
60789 ^ 1 ^ had purchased
60790 ^ 1 ^ them and divided
60791 ^ 1 ^ and made the tribes
60792 ^ 1 ^ yet they tempted
60793 ^ 1 ^ but turned back
60794 ^ 1 ^ and dealt unfaithfully
60795 ^ 1 ^ like their fathers
60796 ^ 1 ^ they were turned aside
60797 ^ 1 ^ for they provoked him to anger
60798 ^ 1 ^ with their high places
60799 ^ 1 ^ and moved him to jealousy
60800 ^ 1 ^ this  he was wroth
60801 ^ 1 ^ so that he forsook

60803 ^ 1 ^ also unto the sword
60804 ^ 1 ^ with his inheritance
60805 ^ 1 ^ and their maidens

61668 ^ 1 ^ to deal subtlely
61669 ^ 1 ^ with his servants
61670 ^ 1 ^ they showed
61671 ^ 1 ^ among them and wonders
61672 ^ 1 ^ and made it dark
61673 ^ 1 ^ and they rebelled
61674 ^ 1 ^ brought forth frogs in abundance
61675 ^ 1 ^ and lice
61676 ^ 1 ^ them hail
61677 ^ 1 ^ for rain
61678 ^ 1 ^ and flaming

61686 ^ 1 ^ one feeble
61687 ^ 1 ^ person among their tribes
61688 ^ 1 ^ when they departed
61689 ^ 1 ^ he spread
61690 ^ 1 ^ the people asked

61692 ^ 1 ^ in the dry places
61693 ^ 1 ^ them the lands
61694 ^ 1 ^ and they inherited
61695 ^ 1 ^ they might observe
61696 ^ 1 ^ his laws
61697 ^ 1 ^ can utter
61698 ^ 1 ^ the mighty acts

61700 ^ 1 ^ and he that doeth
61701 ^ 1 ^ with the favor
61702 ^ 1 ^ that thou bearest unto thy people
61703 ^ 1 ^ o visit
61704 ^ 1 ^ me with thy salvation
61705 ^ 1 ^ that i may see

61710 ^ 1 ^ that i may glory
61711 ^ 1 ^ we have committed iniquity
61712 ^ 1 ^ of thy mercies
61713 ^ 1 ^ but provoked
61714 ^ 1 ^ even at the red
61715 ^ 1 ^ nevertheless he saved
61716 ^ 1 ^ them for his names sake
61717 ^ 1 ^ that he might make
61718 ^ 1 ^ his mighty power
61719 ^ 1 ^ to be known
61720 ^ 1 ^ also and it was dried up
61721 ^ 1 ^ so he led
61722 ^ 1 ^ them through the depths
61723 ^ 1 ^ as through the wilderness
61724 ^ 1 ^ them  and redeemed
61725 ^ 1 ^ then believed
61726 ^ 1 ^ they his words
61727 ^ 1 ^ they soon
61728 ^ 1 ^ forgot
61729 ^ 1 ^ they waited
61730 ^ 1 ^ for his counsel
61731 ^ 1 ^ but lusted exceedingly
61732 ^ 1 ^ them their request
61733 ^ 1 ^ but sent
61734 ^ 1 ^ into their soul
61735 ^ 1 ^ they envied
61736 ^ 1 ^ also in the camp
61737 ^ 1 ^ the saint
61738 ^ 1 ^ and swallowed up
61739 ^ 1 ^ of abiram
61740 ^ 1 ^ in their company
61741 ^ 1 ^ the molten image
61742 ^ 1 ^ thus they changed
61743 ^ 1 ^ into the similitude
61744 ^ 1 ^ they forgot
61745 ^ 1 ^ which had done
61746 ^ 1 ^ wondrous works
61747 ^ 1 ^ that he would destroy
61748 ^ 1 ^ them had not
61749 ^ 1 ^ him in the breach
61750 ^ 1 ^ lest he should destroy
61751 ^ 1 ^ yea they despised
61752 ^ 1 ^ but murmured
61753 ^ 1 ^ therefore he lifted up
61754 ^ 1 ^ against them to overthrow
61755 ^ 1 ^ also among the nations
61756 ^ 1 ^ and to scatter
61757 ^ 1 ^ them in the lands
61758 ^ 1 ^ they joined themselves
61759 ^ 1 ^ also unto baalpeor
61760 ^ 1 ^ and ate
61761 ^ 1 ^ thus they provoked him to anger
61762 ^ 1 ^ with their inventions
61763 ^ 1 ^ broke in
61764 ^ 1 ^ and executed judgment
61765 ^ 1 ^ and so the plague
61766 ^ 1 ^ and that was counted
61767 ^ 1 ^ unto him for righteousness
61768 ^ 1 ^ they angered
61769 ^ 1 ^ him also at
61770 ^ 1 ^ so that it went ill
61771 ^ 1 ^ they provoked
61772 ^ 1 ^ so that he spoke unadvisedly
61773 ^ 1 ^ concerning whom
61774 ^ 1 ^ but were mingled
61775 ^ 1 ^ yea they sacrificed
61776 ^ 1 ^ even the blood
61777 ^ 1 ^ and of their daughters
61778 ^ 1 ^ unto the idols
61779 ^ 1 ^ was polluted
61780 ^ 1 ^ thus were they defiled
61781 ^ 1 ^ with their own works
61782 ^ 1 ^ with their own inventions
61783 ^ 1 ^ therefore was the wrath
61784 ^ 1 ^ insomuch that he abhorred
61785 ^ 1 ^ his own inheritance
61786 ^ 1 ^ and they that hated
61787 ^ 1 ^ them ruled
61788 ^ 1 ^ also oppressed
61789 ^ 1 ^ them and they were brought into subjection
61790 ^ 1 ^ did he deliver
61791 ^ 1 ^ them but they
61792 ^ 1 ^ him with their counsel
61793 ^ 1 ^ and were brought low
61794 ^ 1 ^ nevertheless he regarded
61795 ^ 1 ^ and he remembered
61796 ^ 1 ^ for them his covenant
61797 ^ 1 ^ them also to be pitied
61798 ^ 1 ^ those that carried them captives
61799 ^ 1 ^ unto thy holy
61800 ^ 1 ^ and to triumph
61801 ^ 1 ^ let the redeemed
61802 ^ 1 ^ so  whom
61803 ^ 1 ^ them out of the lands
61804 ^ 1 ^ in a solitary
61805 ^ 1 ^ and he led them forth
61806 ^ 1 ^ by the right
61807 ^ 1 ^ that they might go
61808 ^ 1 ^ he satisfieth
61809 ^ 1 ^ the longing
61810 ^ 1 ^ with goodness
61811 ^ 1 ^ such as sit
61812 ^ 1 ^ and in the shadow of death
61813 ^ 1 ^ being bound
61814 ^ 1 ^ in affliction
61815 ^ 1 ^ they rebelled against
61816 ^ 1 ^ and contemned
61817 ^ 1 ^ therefore he brought down
61818 ^ 1 ^ with labor
61819 ^ 1 ^ they fell down
61820 ^ 1 ^ he brought them out
61821 ^ 1 ^ their bands
61822 ^ 1 ^ of their transgression
61823 ^ 1 ^ and because of their iniquities
61824 ^ 1 ^ and they draw near
61825 ^ 1 ^ and he saveth
61826 ^ 1 ^ them from their destructions
61827 ^ 1 ^ and let them sacrifice
61828 ^ 1 ^ in the deep
61829 ^ 1 ^ for he commandeth
61830 ^ 1 ^ and raiseth
61831 ^ 1 ^ the stormy
61832 ^ 1 ^ which lifteth up
61833 ^ 1 ^ they mount up
61834 ^ 1 ^ to the heaven
61835 ^ 1 ^ again to the depths
61836 ^ 1 ^ because of trouble
61837 ^ 1 ^ they reel to and fro
61838 ^ 1 ^ and stagger
61839 ^ 1 ^ like a drunken man
61840 ^ 1 ^ and are at their wits end
61841 ^ 1 ^ and he bringeth them out
61842 ^ 1 ^ of their distresses
61843 ^ 1 ^ the storm
61844 ^ 1 ^ so that the waves
61845 ^ 1 ^ thereof are still
61846 ^ 1 ^ then are they glad
61847 ^ 1 ^ so he bringeth
61848 ^ 1 ^ their desired
61849 ^ 1 ^ let them exalt
61850 ^ 1 ^ him also in the congregation
61851 ^ 1 ^ him in the assembly
61852 ^ 1 ^ into a wilderness
61853 ^ 1 ^ and the watersprings
61854 ^ 1 ^ into dry ground
61855 ^ 1 ^ a fruitful
61856 ^ 1 ^ into barrenness
61857 ^ 1 ^ into watersprings
61858 ^ 1 ^ he maketh the hungry to dwell
61859 ^ 1 ^ that they may prepare
61860 ^ 1 ^ for habitation
61861 ^ 1 ^ which may yield
61862 ^ 1 ^ of increase
61863 ^ 1 ^ he blesseth
61864 ^ 1 ^ them also so that they are multiplied
61865 ^ 1 ^ and suffereth not
61866 ^ 1 ^ to decrease
61867 ^ 1 ^ again they are minished
61868 ^ 1 ^ through oppression
61869 ^ 1 ^ yet setteth he the poor on high
61870 ^ 1 ^ from affliction
61871 ^ 1 ^ him families
61872 ^ 1 ^ it  and rejoice
61873 ^ 1 ^ and will observe

61875 ^ 1 ^ the lovingkindness
61876 ^ 1 ^ with my glory
61877 ^ 1 ^ is mine manasseh
61878 ^ 1 ^ will i triumph
61879 ^ 1 ^ thou  o god
