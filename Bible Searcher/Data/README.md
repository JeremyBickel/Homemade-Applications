These data files came from various places as follows:

1) GrkConc.js, GrkLex.js, HebConc.js, and HebLex.js came from BlueLetterBible.org on their offline CD, version 2.30a.
2) StrongHebrewG.xml came from Hunt & Eaton, www.2LetterLookup.com; David Troidl and David Instone-Brewer, and it was
   first created by James Strong, LL.D., S.T.D. in 1894.
3) strongs-greek-dictionary.js was compiled in electronic format by Ulrik Petersen (ulrikp.org) and was first created
   by James Strong, S.T.D., LL.D. in 1890 under the title, 
   "Dictionary of Greek Words taken from Strong's Exhaustive Concordance".
4) kjvstrongs.csv is my adaptation of a set of html files in a zip file retrieved from
   https://www.ph4.org/_dl.php?back=bbl&a=Bible_English_KJV_Strong&b=bq&c on April 3, 2022.  It uses the 1769 printing
   of KJV, but I don't know who annotated it with the Strong's numbers.
5) POSParts.txt is my extraction of POS tags taken from HebLex.js and GrkLex.js.  Take special note that these
   have irregular spacing but are quoted as-is in POS.cs.
6) HebrewRoots.txt, and HebrewNon-Roots.txt are my compilations of the language used by Strong to denote
   Hebrew roots and non-rooted words.
