These data files came from various places as follows:

1)  GrkConc.js, GrkLex.js, HebConc.js, and HebLex.js came from BlueLetterBible.org on their offline CD, version 2.30a.
2)  StrongHebrewG.xml came from Hunt & Eaton, www.2LetterLookup.com; David Troidl and David Instone-Brewer, and it was
    first created by James Strong, LL.D., S.T.D. in 1894.
3)  strongs-greek-dictionary.js was compiled in electronic format by Ulrik Petersen (ulrikp.org) and was first created
    by James Strong, S.T.D., LL.D. in 1890 under the title, 
    "Dictionary of Greek Words taken from Strong's Exhaustive Concordance".
4)  kjvstrongs.csv is my adaptation of a set of html files in a zip file retrieved from
    https://www.ph4.org/_dl.php?back=bbl&a=Bible_English_KJV_Strong&b=bq&c on April 3, 2022.  It uses the 1769 printing
    of KJV, but I don't know who annotated it with the Strong's numbers.
5)  POSParts.txt is my extraction of POS tags taken from HebLex.js and GrkLex.js.  Take special note that these
    have irregular spacing but are quoted as-is in POS.cs.
6)  HebrewRoots.txt, and HebrewNon-Roots.txt are my compilations of the language used by Strong to denote
    Hebrew roots and non-rooted words.
7)  "Counts for Phrases with Multiple Strongs Numbers.csv" and 
    "Counts for Phrases with Multiple Strongs Numbers, First English Translation.csv" is program output. An example
    of a phrase with multiple Strongs numbers is "among-fold-flock" (from "First English Translation" output),
    which is comprised of the three Strongs numbers 4480, 4356, and 6629 that come after the phrase,
    "him from the sheepfolds:", located at the end of Psalm 78:70.  This sequence only occurs once.
8)  Verses.csv, BLBHebrewLexicon.csv, BLBGreekLexicon.csv, BLBHebrewConcordance.csv, BLBGreekConcordance.csv,
    EnglishPhraseCountsByPhrase.csv, EnglishPhraseCountsByCount.csv, StrongsSequencesBySS.csv, StrongsSequencesByCount.csv,
    CrossReferences.csv, PhrasalConcordance.csv, and the ChainedPhrasalConcordance-[number].csv and 
    ChainedPhrasalConcordance-[number]-Count.csv files are program output.
9)  TAGNT (2) and TOTHT (4) files are from STEPBible (STEPBible.org).
10) cross_references.txt is from Open Bible (www.openbible.info).
