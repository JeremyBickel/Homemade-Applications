who hath wrought  ^ 2
the kingdom over  ^ 2
and the name of the younger  ^ 2
against the philistines  ^ 2
jonathan, behold,  ^ 2
we will pass over  ^ 2
unto these men,  ^ 2
if they say  ^ 2
until we come  ^ 2

of the lord? behold,  ^ 2
thou hast rejected the word  ^ 2
and turn again with  ^ 2
with me, that i may worship  ^ 2
i will not return  ^ 2
with thee: for  ^ 2

of israel will not  ^ 2
repent: for  ^ 2
for he is not  ^ 2
both man and  ^ 2

before the elders  ^ 2
then said samuel,  ^ 2
two hundred thousand  ^ 2
to a city  ^ 2
and utterly destroyed all  ^ 2
how long wilt thou  ^ 2

before samuel.  ^ 2
samuel. and samuel  ^ 2
send and fetch  ^ 2
till he come  ^ 2
said, arise,  ^ 2
david from that day  ^ 2
rose up, and went  ^ 2
but the spirit of the lord  ^ 2
spirit from  ^ 2
and saul's servants  ^ 2
an evil spirit  ^ 2
and said, send  ^ 2
i am come to sacrifice  ^ 2
to sacrifice to the lord.  ^ 2
his son unto  ^ 2
saul. and david  ^ 2
before me; for  ^ 2
and the evil spirit  ^ 2
will show thee  ^ 2
unto and samuel  ^ 2
the lord spoke,  ^ 2
hath the lord chosen  ^ 2
chosen this.  ^ 2
and he said, neither  ^ 2
neither hath the lord  ^ 2
now the philistines gathered together  ^ 2
gathered together their armies  ^ 2
of israel this  ^ 2
and the man went  ^ 2
and the three eldest  ^ 2
went and returned  ^ 2
forty days.  ^ 2
his son, take  ^ 2
these ten  ^ 2
with the philistines.  ^ 2
in the hand  ^ 2
with them, behold,  ^ 2
his father's house  ^ 2
to the man that  ^ 2

what shall be done  ^ 2
shall it be done to the man  ^ 2
on a mountain  ^ 2
and fight with  ^ 2
man's heart  ^ 2
philistine. and saul  ^ 2
with him: for  ^ 2
and smote him, and slew  ^ 2
as one of  ^ 2
he will deliver  ^ 2
david, go,  ^ 2
upon his head;  ^ 2
i cannot go  ^ 2
comest to  ^ 2
and the philistine said  ^ 2
a dog, that  ^ 2
thou comest  ^ 2
unto the fowls of the air,  ^ 2
then said david  ^ 2
there is a god  ^ 2
for the battle  ^ 2
the lord saveth  ^ 2
and he fell upon  ^ 2
prevailed over  ^ 2
and stood upon  ^ 2
and pursued the philistines,  ^ 2
of the philistine,  ^ 2
between his shoulders.  ^ 2
and said unto them, why  ^ 2
and it came to pass, when he had made an end  ^ 2
and david played  ^ 2
upon saul,  ^ 2
hand. and saul  ^ 2
and saul cast  ^ 2
david even to the wall  ^ 2
was afraid of  ^ 2
of david,  ^ 2
and came in before  ^ 2
the people. and david  ^ 2
that i should be  ^ 2
daughter loved  ^ 2
said, i will give  ^ 2
on this manner  ^ 2
said, thus  ^ 2
he and his men,  ^ 2
was upon him, and gave  ^ 2
cities of israel,  ^ 2
to meet king  ^ 2
when david was returned  ^ 2
was returned from the slaughter  ^ 2
saul hath slain  ^ 2
hath slain his thousands,  ^ 2
was very wroth,  ^ 2
and saul sought  ^ 2
messengers to take  ^ 2

why hast thou deceived  ^ 2
saul my father  ^ 2
again the third  ^ 2
he sent other  ^ 2
and said, where  ^ 2

the ends of the earth;  ^ 2
the priest's servant  ^ 2
with the people  ^ 2
also before  ^ 2
with a linen ephod.  ^ 2
samuel grew  ^ 2
three sons  ^ 2
they lay with  ^ 2
i hear  ^ 2
a man sin  ^ 2
with the lord,  ^ 2
the lord is a god  ^ 2
and the house of thy father,  ^ 2
the lord saith,  ^ 2
wherefore the lord  ^ 2
of israel saith,  ^ 2
of thy father's house,  ^ 2
thy two sons,  ^ 2
forever. and it shall come to pass,  ^ 2
that every one that is left  ^ 2
he raiseth up the poor  ^ 2
the poor out of the dust,  ^ 2
shall no man  ^ 2

with thee, as  ^ 2
and much more  ^ 2
behold, the arrows  ^ 2
and the king sat  ^ 2
cometh not  ^ 2
not the son  ^ 2
david earnestly asked  ^ 2
earnestly asked leave of  ^ 2
favor in thine eyes,  ^ 2
and he said, let me go,  ^ 2
and david swore  ^ 2
that i have found  ^ 2

and jonathan went  ^ 2
evil is determined  ^ 2
if he say  ^ 2
kindly with  ^ 2
to come upon  ^ 2
and said unto him, why  ^ 2

is under  ^ 2
but there is  ^ 2
or sword?  ^ 2
here under  ^ 2
it : for there is no  ^ 2
his father's house,  ^ 2
then the king sent  ^ 2
sent to call  ^ 2
the priest, the son  ^ 2
against me, to lie in wait,  ^ 2
me, to lie in wait, as at this  ^ 2
as at this day?  ^ 2

and from whence came  ^ 2
came they unto  ^ 2
they unto thee? and hezekiah  ^ 2
thee? and hezekiah said,  ^ 2
said, they are come  ^ 2
then came isaiah  ^ 2
king hezekiah,  ^ 2
hezekiah, and said  ^ 2
have they seen: there is  ^ 2
nothing among my treasures  ^ 2
among my treasures that  ^ 2
i have not showed  ^ 2

in thine house? and hezekiah  ^ 2
answered, all  ^ 2
hezekiah, hear  ^ 2
day, shall be carried  ^ 2
nothing shall be left,  ^ 2
shall be left, saith  ^ 2
come, that all  ^ 2
that is in thine house,  ^ 2

babylon is fallen,  ^ 2
and all the graven images  ^ 2
and he answered and said,  ^ 2
hath spoken the burden  ^ 2
of jerusalem, and the houses  ^ 2
of hosts, surely  ^ 2

o daughter of the chaldeans:  ^ 2
for thou shalt no  ^ 2

were eating and drinking  ^ 2
and drinking wine  ^ 2
wine in their eldest  ^ 2
in their eldest brother's  ^ 2
unto job,  ^ 2
job, and said,  ^ 2
the servants with the edge  ^ 2
of the sword; and i  ^ 2
there came a great  ^ 2
a great wind  ^ 2
from the wilderness,  ^ 2
in all this  ^ 2
and a very great  ^ 2
thousand camels,  ^ 2
and sent and called  ^ 2
for job  ^ 2
thus did  ^ 2
and satan came  ^ 2
a day when the sons  ^ 2
when the sons of god  ^ 2
came to present themselves  ^ 2
to present themselves before  ^ 2
the lord, and satan  ^ 2
and said, from going to and fro  ^ 2
from going to and fro in the earth,  ^ 2
in the earth, and from walking up and down  ^ 2
and from walking up and down and the lord  ^ 2
like him in the earth,  ^ 2
in the earth, a perfect  ^ 2
a perfect and an upright  ^ 2
and an upright man,  ^ 2
man, one that feareth  ^ 2
god, and escheweth  ^ 2
and escheweth evil?  ^ 2
satan, hast thou considered  ^ 2
hast thou considered my servant  ^ 2
job, that  ^ 2
in the bitterness of my soul.  ^ 2
if i be wicked,  ^ 2
thine indignation upon  ^ 2
as though i had not  ^ 2
i had not been;  ^ 2
before i go  ^ 2
have made me and fashioned  ^ 2
then answered zophar  ^ 2
zophar the naamathite,  ^ 2
the naamathite, and said,  ^ 2
he poureth contempt  ^ 2
contempt upon  ^ 2
upon princes,  ^ 2
where there is no way.  ^ 2
who knoweth not  ^ 2
am not inferior  ^ 2
in all these  ^ 2
hear diligently my speech,  ^ 2
wherefore hidest  ^ 2
hidest thou thy face,  ^ 2
to the almighty,  ^ 2
watch over  ^ 2
turn from  ^ 2
trouble and anguish  ^ 2
he runneth upon  ^ 2
yea, thou  ^ 2
who shall see  ^ 2
from me, and mine acquaintance  ^ 2
of all this  ^ 2
sat down among  ^ 2
with him in  ^ 2
surely he shall not  ^ 2
in the day of his wrath.  ^ 2
is the portion of a wicked  ^ 2
of a wicked man  ^ 2
upon earth,  ^ 2
neither shall his place  ^ 2
unto god, depart  ^ 2
of the wicked is far  ^ 2
then eliphaz the temanite  ^ 2
the temanite answered  ^ 2
how doth god  ^ 2
doth god know?  ^ 2
the words of his mouth  ^ 2
cut off before  ^ 2
even today  ^ 2
behold, i go  ^ 2
without clothing,  ^ 2
eye shall see  ^ 2
and heat  ^ 2
and if it be not  ^ 2
moreover job  ^ 2
job continued  ^ 2
continued his parable,  ^ 2
if his children  ^ 2
silver as the dust,  ^ 2
their hands at  ^ 2
surely there is  ^ 2
and where is the place  ^ 2
is the place of understanding?  ^ 2
the fear of the lord,  ^ 2
or with  ^ 2
shine upon  ^ 2
i cry unto  ^ 2
appointed for all  ^ 2
to destruction,  ^ 2
what shall i answer  ^ 2
did not he that made  ^ 2
if i rejoiced  ^ 2
out of the way,  ^ 2
also will show  ^ 2
will show mine opinion.  ^ 2
was his wrath kindled,  ^ 2
kindled, because  ^ 2
the son of barachel  ^ 2
of the night, when deep sleep  ^ 2
when deep sleep falleth  ^ 2
upon men,  ^ 2
his soul from  ^ 2
from the pit,  ^ 2
he looketh upon  ^ 2
