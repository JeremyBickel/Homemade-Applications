either great or small,  ^ 2
and the king sat upon  ^ 2
that day: for  ^ 2
david earnestly asked leave of  ^ 2
i have found favor in thine eyes,  ^ 2
that i have found grace  ^ 2
and said unto him, wherefore  ^ 2
cried after the lad,  ^ 2
one with another,  ^ 2
in the name of the lord, saying,  ^ 2
achish the king of gath.  ^ 2

and fell at his feet,  ^ 2
and it shall come to pass, when the lord  ^ 2
by the morning light  ^ 2
and stood on the top  ^ 2
my lord, o king. and he said,  ^ 2
before the lord; for  ^ 2
other gods. now  ^ 2
